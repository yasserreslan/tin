# The Tin runtime and the server stack: how they work

The runtime is the package in `lib/runtime/`: portable files plus `*_darwin.tin` /
`*_linux.tin` (and `*_linux_<arch>.tin`) for the OS layer, compiled into every strict
program. It is written in strict Tin with the standard-library-only features
(LANGUAGE.md §18). The HTTP server (`anvil`), cores (`hearth`), messages (`relay`) and
JSON (`argo`) are ordinary library packages built on it.

## 1. Value layouts

| value | representation |
|---|---|
| integers, bools | the value, sign- or zero-extended in a 64-bit register; stored at their width |
| `f64` | IEEE double in a d register |
| `str` | pointer to `[length (8 bytes)][bytes][NUL]`; literals live in the executable's constant segment |
| slice | pointer to a 32-byte header `[len, cap, data pointer, region]`; `region` is 1 when the data lives in the ingot heap |
| map | pointer to an 80-byte header `[count, capacity, keys, values, control bytes, string keys?, shift, tombstones, hashes, region]`; open addressing, power-of-two capacity |
| struct | pointer to its fields, laid out widest first with natural alignment, size rounded to 8 |
| `?T` | the T pointer, or 0 for nil |
| fault | a pointer to a str holding the full message (`outer: inner` when wrapped), or 0 for nil; four words before the str hold the record `[trace, joined, identity, cause]` (notes/interface_faults.md) |
| func value | the code address |

A fault is still one word. `fail`, `fail(...)`, `say.Fault` and the `fault` package make it
with `rt_fault_raw` (lib/runtime/runtime.tin): one allocation of
`[trace][joined][identity][cause][len][bytes][NUL]`, and the word points at `len`, so every
reader of the message (`say`, `{err}`, `err.Error()`, argo, `say.Str(err) == "..."`) sees a
plain str. `identity` is nonzero for sentinels (the runtime's own are 1 to 6, package-level
`fault("...")` declarations are numbered from 64 by the compiler), `cause` is the wrapped
fault, `joined` points at `[n][fault]...` for `fault.Join`, and `trace` holds a panic's
backtrace. `keep(err)` deep-copies the chain (`rt_keep_fault`). Runtime code makes the
standard sentinels with `rt_fault_deadline()`, `rt_fault_canceled()`, `rt_fault_limit()`,
`rt_fault_overloaded()`, `rt_fault_draining()` and `rt_fault_panic(msg, trace)` (each an
i64 fault word: `fail cast(fault, rt_fault_deadline())`). The interface is
notes/interface_faults.md.

Map hashing is keyed with 128 random bits drawn once per process in `rt_init` (one key for
every core, so a map built on one core is found on another): strings (and struct or enum
keys, encoded as bytes) use SipHash-1-3, integers the splitmix64 finalizer over `k ^ key`.
A client cannot precompute keys that collide (hash flooding). Iteration follows insertion
order, so no output depends on the key. The table grows at half load.

## 2. The core context (x28)

Every thread that runs Tin code (a core) has a context block; register x28 points at it
for the thread's whole life (callee-saved in both ABIs, so C code never disturbs it).

| word | name | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0, 1 | ctxBump, ctxEnd | request-pool bump pointer and the end of the current chunk |
| 2 | ctxFmt | the current `say` format frame |
| 3 | ctxFound | the last map lookup's found flag (comma-ok reads) |
| 4 | ctxID | the core number |
| 6 | ctxIngot | 1 while initializers run: allocations go to the ingot heap |
| 7, 8, 9 | ctxPoolBase, ctxPoolMark, ctxPoolExtra | the pool's first chunk, its high-water mark, overflow chunks and big blocks |
| 10 | syscall error | Linux kernel thread error; compiler offsets stay unchanged |
| 11 | vector mode | x86-64 AVX2 capability after CPUID/OSXSAVE/XGETBV checks; zero on arm64 |
| 12–31 | reserved | preserve compiler offsets; heap state is a per-core global |
| 32+ | | the core's copy of every per-core global (global i at word 32+i) |

Context blocks are allocated on their own 128-byte cache lines (`rt_aligned_alloc`) so
cores never share a line.

## 3. Memory

**Request pool.**
- `rt_alloc(n)` rounds n up to 16 and bumps `ctxBump`; when the chunk is full it takes
  a new 4 MiB chunk.
- Blocks of 256 KiB or more get their own calloc'd block, freed at reset.
- `rt_pool_reset()` zeroes the used part of the first chunk, frees the overflow chunks
  and big blocks, and rewinds the bump pointer.
- anvil calls it after every response, `relay`/tick handlers after each run, and
  `hearth.Reset()` exposes it. The compiler rejects reading a local that may hold request
  memory after a `hearth.Reset()` (called directly or through the program's own functions)
  until it is assigned again, on any path, loops included: keep() it before the reset or
  create it after.
- Plain programs never reset: they release everything at exit.

**Ingot heap.** `rt_ingot_alloc(n)` returns zeroed, 16-byte-aligned memory from the
core's mmap heap. The 16 classes are 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256 ... 3072,
4096 bytes, including a 16-byte `[owning heap, size word]` header (the size word's bits
47-62 hold the reclamation count, below). Local free
lists and 1 MiB slab bump sources live in the heap's own page mapping. Larger blocks
have a page-rounded mapping of their own; `rt_ingot_free(p)` releases them with
`munmap`. Request pool chunks use the same checked mapping allocator.

`rt_ingot_free(p)` returns a small block directly when called on its owning core.
A different core appends it to the owner's return queue under an atomic lock; the
owner drains that queue before allocating. Blocks remain tied to their owner even
when returned elsewhere. Heap pages and slabs live for the process lifetime. Maps release
their old ingot tables when they grow. The compiler uses the same memory core with a single heap.

Every allocation and mapping checks its size and failure result. Failure writes
`tin: out of memory (N bytes)` to stderr from static bytes and stack words, then exits
with status 2. This path creates no context, pool, format frame or heap block.
Memory leaves use bounded NEON on arm64 and SSE2 on x86-64. Strict x86-64 programs
cache AVX2 availability in context word 11 after checking CPU support and OS-managed
XMM/YMM state. Medium forward copies and long comparisons/scans use AVX2 when available;
small operations and unsupported CPUs retain SSE2. `TIN_ALLOC_TEST=1 TIN_MEMORY_SCALAR=1` forces the SSE2 path for
correctness checks.

`TIN_ALLOC_TEST=1` enables the test-only `TIN_FAIL_ALLOC_AFTER=N` counter, including
startup allocations and mappings. Without that explicit flag the variable is ignored.

**Initialization.**
- `rt_init` creates core 0's context in ingot mode.
- Global initializers allocate in the ingot heap.
- `rt_main_begin` switches to the request pool before `main.main`.
- Each extra core runs `__core_init` (the per-core global initializers) in ingot mode,
  then switches to its pool.

**Arenas.** An `arena { }` block (#236) allocates from a pool of its own, made when it is
entered and freed (chunks and big blocks) when it ends; only its value, copied out by a
generated `arenacopy$N`, survives. Arena memory is pool memory: it is never counted or
reclaimed by the ingot heap's machinery. See section 9, "Arenas".

**keep.** `keep(x)` calls a generated `keep$N` function per type. It copies strings
(`rt_keep_str`), structs (`rt_keep_raw`, then their reference fields), slices
(`rt_keep_slice`, then elements) and maps (a new ingot map, entry by entry) into the
ingot heap.

**Reclaiming long-lived memory (#176, notes/interface_mem.md).** Each block of a core's
heap counts the long-lived references to it in its size word. `keep$N` counts what its
copy holds; stores into globals and provably long-lived containers count the new value and
drop the old one; maps and long-lived slices count their own entries and elements. A
block whose count falls to 0 waits in the core's limbo until everything that could have
borrowed it is past: every task alive when it was dropped has ended, and the core's own
stack has reset its pool (the end of a request or tick, `hearth.Reset()`). Then its
children are dropped and it is freed. So `let u = cache[k]` stays valid for the rest of the
request even if another request replaces the entry. Values made while a core initializes
its globals, and values stored where the compiler cannot count (through a parameter), are
pinned: they are never freed. A task that lives for a long time (a WebSocket, a `detach`
loop) holds back releases on its core; past 2^20 queued blocks a core pins what it drops
instead, so such a core leaks as before reclamation but its limbo stays bounded.
`hearth.RcStats()` reports the counted blocks (pinned ones included), their bytes and the
limbo length.

## 4. Cores and threads: hearth

- `rt_spawn_core(entry, arg)` starts a pthread with an 8 MiB stack. The thread creates
  its context (`rt_ctx_new`), sets x28, runs `__core_init`, sets its scheduling hint
  (`rt_core_qos`: QoS user-interactive on macOS; CPU pinning on Linux) and calls
  `entry(arg)`.
- `hearth.Run(n, f)` spawns cores 1..n-1, runs `f(0)` on the calling thread, and waits
  for the others (an atomic counter).
- `hearth.Cores()` counts usable CPUs: `sysconf` on macOS. On Linux it is the minimum of
  online CPUs, the affinity mask and the cgroup CPU quota (`cpu.max` /
  `cpu.cfs_quota_us`).
- `TIN_CORES` overrides the count for anvil.

## 5. Messages: relay

Each core has a box in a process-wide array of 256 boxes. A box is:
- a lock-free multi-producer, single-consumer linked queue (Vyukov's algorithm):
  producers swap the head atomically, the owner pops at the tail;
- a wake pipe (an eventfd on Linux is planned);
- a "waiting" flag.

`Send(core, msg)` copies the message into a malloc'd node, links it, and writes one byte
to the wake pipe only if the receiver set its waiting flag. `Recv()` pops, or sets the
flag, re-checks (no lost wake-ups), then blocks in `poll` on the pipe: it stops the whole
core and ignores deadlines and cancels. `Next()` does the same through
`rt_task_wait(pipe, 1, 0)`, so inside a task the core serves others meanwhile, and a deadline
(`within`, the request's) or a cancel fails it with `rt_wait_fault()` (#316); one task per core
watches the pipe and the others look again every millisecond. Event loops
register `relay.WakeFD()`, call `relay.Arm()` before sleeping and `relay.Drain(h)` when it
fires. Messages are copied into the receiver's request pool.

## 6. Output and formatting

- `say` output goes through a 64 KiB stdout buffer guarded by a spinlock (shared by all
  cores). It is flushed when full, at exit, at every newline on a terminal, and by
  `rt_flush()`.
- Formatting uses a per-core frame: the compiler emits one `rt_fmt_*` call per argument
  by static type (`rt_fmt_i`, `_u`, `_s`, `_f`, `_b`, `_e`, slices, maps, structs).
- No frame is open while user code runs: the compiler evaluates every argument that is more
  than a literal or a name into a hidden local before the begin call (`say_hoist` in
  lower.tin). The frame belongs to the core, so an argument that runs other tasks, such as
  `say.Line(anvil.Serve(...))`, would otherwise share it with every request (#347). The
  use-after-reset check sees those locals as assigned where they are evaluated.
- Floats are printed in their shortest exact form. A fast path finds the fewest decimals
  k for which rint(|x|·10^k)/10^k == |x|, exact for values below 2^53. Otherwise
  the integer-only conversion core finds the shortest decimal in the interval between
  adjacent floats. Precision formats use exact decimal shifts and nearest-even rounding.
  `rt_float_json` uses JSON's exponent rule.

## 7. Panics and backtraces

- `rt_panic(msg)` flushes stdout, prints `panic: msg`, walks the frame-pointer chain from
  `__fp()`, names each return address with `dladdr`, and exits with status 2.
- The walk skips `rt_` frames and stops at the program entry.
- On Linux the linker emits a read-only Tin table of function start/end/name records.
  Backtrace lookup uses image-relative ranges, including under ASLR; printed names stay unchanged.
- `rt_bounds_fail2(i, n)` and `rt_div_fail()` are the cold paths of failed checks.

## 8. The OS layer

Everything that differs between macOS and Linux sits behind `rt_` helpers with the same
names in both OS files:

| helper | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| `rt_errno()` | `__error()` | core context word 10, set from negative kernel results |
| `rt_mono_ns()`, `rt_wall_ns()` | `clock_gettime_nsec_np(8 / 0)` | kernel vDSO clock with clock_gettime syscall fallback |
| `rt_random(p, n)` | `arc4random_buf` | `getrandom` (loop) |
| `rt_ncpus()` | `sysconf(58)` | affinity mask plus cgroup quota |
| `rt_sockaddr_in(sa, ip, port)` | `sin_len` + family bytes | u16 family |
| `rt_ai_addr(ai)` | addrinfo + 32 | unused; Tin DNS builds sockaddr directly |
| `rt_nosigpipe(fd)` | `SO_NOSIGPIPE` | ignore SIGPIPE process-wide |
| `rt_stat_mode/size/mtime/dev/ino(st)` | struct stat offsets | kernel offsets (st_mode differs between arm64 and amd64: per-arch file) |
| `rt_dirent_name(ent)` | `d_namlen` + `d_name@21` | bounded getdents64 record, name@19 |
| `rt_core_qos(core)` | QoS user-interactive | CPU pinning when safe |

Constants with the same names in both files: `EINTR EAGAIN EINPROGRESS ENOENT EEXIST
ENOTDIR EINVAL EMFILE ENFILE O_WRITE_CREATE O_APPEND_CREATE O_NONBLOCK F_GETFL F_SETFL
SOL_SOCKET SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEPORT SO_ERROR SO_RCVTIMEO SO_SNDTIMEO TARGET_LINUX`.
`notes/linux_abi.md` holds every verified value and layout. Linux's `rt_sys_*`
wrappers invoke a compiler-emitted leaf (`svc #0` / `syscall`) and turn kernel
-4095..-1 results into -1 plus the calling thread's error word. No syscall reads libc
errno. Directory handles own a 32 KiB getdents64 buffer, validate each record before
reading it, refill as needed, and resolve unknown types with lstat. The kernel signal
set is 8 bytes; signal handlers return through Tin's frame-free rt_sigreturn leaf.
Cores are `clone` threads, and the environment and auxiliary vector come from the initial
stack (`rt_getenv`, `rt_getauxval`). Clock lookup reads the kernel vDSO from AT_SYSINFO_EHDR,
with the raw syscall as fallback. Linux programs import nothing: the ELF writers emit only
static executables, and notes/libc_inventory.md has no active Linux entry left (#125).
Externs remain only in the macOS runtime files.

UTC calendar/Date formatting, errno messages and Linux backtrace lookup are Tin code.
Darwin errno codes 0..106 use the stable Tin message table. Newer/unknown codes
retain libSystem text because code assignments vary between macOS development releases.
Linux errno messages use Tin exclusively.
Linux TTY detection uses ioctl TCGETS, hostname uses uname, and sleeps use nanosleep.

## 9. The HTTP server: anvil

**Event loops.** One per core:
- kqueue on macOS, epoll on Linux, behind `ev_*` functions in `anvil_darwin.tin` /
  `anvil_linux.tin`.
- Connections are edge-triggered (`EV_CLEAR` / `EPOLLET`); listeners, pipes and wakers
  are level-triggered.
- Ticks (`anvil.OnTick`) use EVFILT_TIMER on macOS and timerfd on Linux.

**Accepting.**
- macOS: core 0 owns the listener and deals connections round-robin to the cores
  through per-core pipes (macOS's `SO_REUSEPORT` does not balance).
- Linux: every core has its own `SO_REUSEPORT` listener and accepts its own
  connections; balancing on top of the kernel's hashing is being added.
- At most 64 accepts per wake-up.
- When file descriptors run out, a spare `/dev/null` descriptor is closed to accept
  and drop one waiting client instead of spinning.

**A connection** is a 96-byte record: fd, pending input buffer, pending output buffer,
close-after-write flag, writing flag, bytes needed. Idle connections hold no buffers.

**Reading.**
- Each core reads into one 256 KiB scratch buffer.
- A read that fills the buffer is repeated, since an edge-triggered socket must be
  drained.
- Complete requests are parsed in place:
  - request line;
  - headers, scanned with `memchr`; each name must be a token followed by `:`, and
    only `Content-Length`, `Connection` and `Transfer-Encoding` are interpreted;
  - body. A `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` body (#349) is decoded in place once its last
    chunk and trailer section have arrived: the data of each chunk moves down to follow the
    header block, then the trailer field lines, which `Header` reads after the header
    block's. Chunk extensions are skipped, every line must end in CRLF, and replay records
    the decoded request (a `Content-Length`, the trailers as fields).
- An incomplete request is copied into the connection's own buffer, sized to the
  request when its length is known (up to 64 MiB).
- A hang-up reported with the last data closes the connection once its output is
  written. A client that only shuts down its sending side still gets the response to a
  request that is waiting; the connection closes after it.

**Handlers** get two per-core objects:
- `anvil.Req`: method (interned for common verbs), path, query (copied into the pool),
  raw header and body pointers for `Header()`, `Body()` and `Param()`;
- `anvil.Out`: `Body []u8`, status, content type, extra headers.

**Responding.**
- After the handler returns, the response goes into a per-core output buffer: the
  status line from a table, then a per-core cached block with `Server` and the `Date`
  header (refreshed when the second changes), then the content type, extra headers,
  `Content-Length` and the body (omitted for HEAD).
- The buffer is reset per request and the request pool is wiped.
- All responses produced from one read go out in one `write`.
- **Streaming** (#350): a handler that calls `w.Stream()` writes its response itself, as it goes.
  The first `Write`, `Flush` or `SendFile` takes the connection out of the event loop (its
  descriptor leaves epoll or kqueue and `conns` for the duration, so no stale event reaches
  it), writes the output earlier pipelined responses left, and builds the head in a
  per-connection scratch buffer: `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, or `Content-Length` when
  `w.Length(n)` was called, or neither and `Connection: close` for an HTTP/1.0 client. Each write
  goes straight to the socket from the handler's task (a chunk is framed in the scratch buffer,
  at most 64 KiB at a time; a Content-Length body is written from the caller's memory) and waits
  with `rt_task_wait` for a full socket, for at most the write timeout, so nothing is held in
  the request pool. After every write the request deadline restarts, so it bounds the time between
  writes, not the whole stream. `SendFile` moves a file with `sendfile(2)` in pieces of 1 MiB on
  a helper thread (the same call on macOS), framed as chunks inside a chunked stream. When the
  handler returns, the last chunk goes into the output buffer, the descriptor is registered again
  and the connection goes on as after any response: the next pipelined request is served. A write
  that fails, a cancel or a drain, `w.Abort()`, a body shorter than its `Content-Length`, a
  panic, or an HTTP/1.0 stream all close the connection instead of ending the response, so the
  client never takes a cut-off stream for a complete one. `w.Closed()` peeks at the socket to
  see a client that left between two writes.

**Backpressure.** If the socket does not take everything, the remainder is kept in the
connection, reading is disabled, and write readiness is awaited; when the output drains,
reading resumes and buffered input is served.

**Limits and errors.**
- A request line or header block over 64 KiB gets 414 / 431 and close.
- A malformed request line (including control bytes such as a bare CR, NUL or tab, or a
  version other than `HTTP/1.<digit>`), a header line that is not `name: value` (no colon,
  whitespace before it, obs-fold, a name that is not a token), a CR or NUL inside a header
  line, an HTTP/1.1 request without exactly one `Host`, a bad `Content-Length`, a malformed
  chunked body, chunked listed twice, or chunked together with `Content-Length` (RFC 9112
  6.3) gets 400; a transfer coding other than chunked gets 501.
- A request with `Expect: 100-continue` whose body has not arrived gets
  `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` first (clients such as curl and the AWS SDKs wait for it).
- An absolute-form target (`GET http://host/path?q HTTP/1.1`) is routed on its path and
  query; an empty path is `/`.
- Bodies are limited to 64 MiB by default (413), a chunked body by its decoded length (and
  its chunk framing by the limit plus 64 KiB); `anvil.Limits` or `TIN_MAX_BODY` changes it.
- **Timeouts** (`anvil.Timeouts`, or the environment): a request's line and headers must
  arrive within 10 s of its first byte (`TIN_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS`), and the whole request
  within 60 s (`TIN_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`); a keep-alive connection with no request in progress
  is closed after 60 s (`TIN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`); a response the client stops reading is
  dropped after 30 s without progress (`TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`). A new connection gets the
  header timeout for its first request. 0 turns one off. While a handler runs, only the
  request deadline (`anvil.Deadline`) applies. Each core checks its connections' deadlines
  once a second, in its event loop (no timer per connection).
- **Closing after an error:** a connection closed after a parse error, 413 or 503 shuts down
  its sending side and reads and drops input for up to 2 s before it closes (a lingering
  close, as nginx does): closing with unread input would reset the connection, and a client
  still sending its body would lose the response.
- **Memory and connections:** the partial requests one core buffers are limited to 256 MiB
  (`TIN_MAX_BUFFERED`): a new partial request past it gets 503 and close. Each core takes at
  most 16384 connections (`TIN_MAX_CONNS`); more are closed at accept.
- **Memory bounds by default (#356):** every request has a memory budget (see Budgets below):
  `TIN_REQUEST_MEMORY` bytes, or when it is unset a quarter of the memory limit per core (the
  cgroup's `memory.max`, else the machine's physical memory), at least 64 MiB; 256 MiB on one
  core gives 64 MiB, 16 GiB on four cores 1 GiB. A request past it ends with 500 and the
  server goes on. `TIN_MEMORY_SOFT` (bytes; by default 90% of the cgroup limit, none without
  one) bounds the whole process: while the pool and ingot bytes of every core are past it,
  new requests get 503 with `Retry-After: 1` before their handler runs (as an admission
  refusal: `on server.overload` runs), and the requests already running go on. The bytes
  counted are what the heaps have mapped (slabs and large blocks, an atomic count kept at
  each mapping) less the pools' first chunks, which requests mostly never touch; reading
  them costs the admission two loads. `TIN_REQUEST_MEMORY=0` and `TIN_MEMORY_SOFT=0` turn
  the bounds off.
- HTTP/1.0 closes unless keep-alive is asked for, and a kept HTTP/1.0 connection gets
  `Connection: keep-alive` in every response. `Connection` is read as a token list:
  `close` anywhere closes the connection after the response.
- `$PORT` replaces the port of the address passed to `Serve`.

Balancing: on Linux each core accepts on its own `SO_REUSEPORT` listener, then hands a new
connection to the least-loaded core (per-core live-connection counters) when its own load
is more than one above it. Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT: see PORTING.md §4.

### Request tasks (v0.4)

Every request's handler runs in a **task**: its own 256 KiB stack (mmap'd, with a 16 KiB
`PROT_NONE` guard region below it, so an overflow faults instead of corrupting memory) and
its own request pool. `rt_task_run` switches into a task from the core's stack;
`rt_task_swap`, hand-assembled per CPU, saves and loads only what a call preserves (arm64:
x19–x27, x29, x30, sp, d8–d15; x86-64: rbx, rbp, r12–r14, rsp and the return address), about
ten nanoseconds. x28 / r15, the core context, is the same on every task of a core, and the
core's pool words (bump, end, base, mark, extra) and formatting frame stack are swapped
in and out with the task. Formatting arguments may wait without sharing frames with
another task. Resource cleanup callbacks run before the owning pool is reset.

- A handler that never waits finishes inside `rt_task_run`: two switches and nothing else,
  so the fast path keeps its speed (measured: 308–310k req/s on one core, as before).
- A handler that waits (`tide.Wait`, `tide.Sleep`, `wire` calls, `quarry` file calls) yields: the request's bytes are copied out of the shared read buffer, the
  connection stops serving its later pipelined requests (responses stay in order), and the
  core goes back to its event loop. Sleeping tasks sit in a per-core min-heap; the loop
  waits at most until the earliest wake-up (`ev_wait(ms)`), then resumes due tasks. A task
  that finishes appends its response, flushes, and its connection serves what queued.
- Deadlines: each request's waits give up at `anvil.Deadline(ms)` / `TIN_DEADLINE_MS`
  (default 30 s) after it started: `tide.Wait` then fails with `deadline exceeded`.
- Backpressure: at 4096 waiting requests on a core, new requests get 503.
- A panic in a handler (an index out of range, a division by zero, `panic`) ends only its
  request: `panic: ...` and the backtrace go to stderr, the task's cleanups run and its pool
  is reset, its stack is abandoned and reused, and the request gets 500 and its connection
  closes. Other requests, waiting ones on the same core included, go on. Before the cleanups,
  the deferred calls of every frame the panic leaves run, innermost first (#230: each `defer`
  puts a record on the task's defer chain, made by a generated `defer$N`; a return runs the
  chain back to its function's mark). A panic while they or the cleanups run ends the process
  after printing both messages. Ticks (`anvil.OnTick`) and relay handlers (`anvil.OnRelay`)
  are guarded implicitly too (#230): each tick, and each round of relay messages, runs through
  `rt_guard_call` on a guard stack, so a panic in one logs `panic: ...` and its backtrace, runs
  the deferred calls it registered, ends that tick or that message's handler, and the core goes
  on (the remaining messages are handled at once). A panic in `main` outside a `guard`, or a
  stack overflow, still ends the process.
- `guard { ... }` (#230, edition 1) is a boundary that turns a panic inside it into a fault:
  the panic's message goes to stderr with its backtrace, the deferred calls and the
  resource-cleanup callbacks registered inside the guard run, and the guard's value is a
  `fault.Panic` fault (`panic: <message>`) whose `fault.Backtrace(err)` is that backtrace, one
  function per line (#142). Cleanups registered before the guard wait for their task's end.
  `guard f(x)` (or `guard try f(x)`) is the same guard around one call (#142). A spawned
  child's panic is its scope's fault in the same form. The guard does not yet discard the
  memory the guarded code allocated: that waits for sub-regions (#236).
- A connection closed while its request waits is marked dead and freed when the task ends.
- Finished tasks free overflow pool chunks and big blocks. Each core caches at most
  64 task records; excess records release their base pool and unmap their stacks.
  Heavy cached tasks discard complete base-pool and stack pages with
  `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`; stack mappings are released if advice fails. Headers and
  pool boundary pages remain intact. Light tasks reuse their zeroed pools and stack
  pages without an extra syscall per request. Stale timer entries are invalidated
  before a task record is released or reused. The 300-request burst check exercises
  deep suspended stacks and dirty overflow pools, then verifies the Linux RSS bound.

### Non-blocking I/O and helper threads (v0.4)

- `rt_task_wait(fd, want, timeout)` is the one wait primitive: inside a task it registers
  the fd once (kqueue `EV_ONESHOT` / epoll `EPOLLONESHOT`) through the core's `waitHook`,
  pushes a timer for the earlier of the timeout and the request deadline, and yields. The
  event or the timer resumes the task, whichever comes first; a generation number makes the
  loser stale (a stale timer is skipped, a stale fd watch is removed by `waitCancel`).
  Outside a task it falls back to `poll` or a sleep, so the same code works in `main`.
- `wire` sockets are non-blocking: connect, read, write and accept wait with
  `rt_task_wait` on `EAGAIN`. `Conn.SetTimeout` bounds each wait; past it the call fails
  with `wire: read timed out` (or connect/write), past the deadline with `deadline exceeded`.
- Linux DNS uses nonblocking UDP/TCP sockets and task waits (docs/STDLIB.md, wire contract).
- Work with no non-blocking form (macOS DNS `getaddrinfo`, file reads and writes in `quarry`)
  goes to shared helper threads: as many as there are cores, at least 4 (`TIN_HELPERS` sets the
  number, 1 to 256). `rt_helper_run(f, job, drop)` queues a heap-owned job, signals a
  non-blocking wake pipe and parks within the request deadline. A core may have 4096 jobs out
  at once; its next task waits for one to finish (woken by the completion on its own core),
  within its deadline, instead of failing (#357). Not done: `io_uring` on Linux.
  A helper runs `f(job)` and writes the completion to the owning core's done pipe.
  Inputs and results live outside request pools, so an expired request may return and
  reuse its task safely. A late completion calls `drop(job)` and never resumes the old
  task. Already-running system calls can still finish after the caller's deadline;
  their results are discarded. Outside a task the helper runs synchronously.
- Standard input and streams (#316): inside a task, when the descriptor is a pipe, socket or
  terminal, `quarry.ReadStdin` and `flume.Reader` wait with `rt_task_wait(fd, 1, 0)` before
  each read and fail with `rt_wait_fault()`; a flume reader's wait fault is cleared by its next
  read. Regular files, other devices and code outside a task read directly, as before.
  `relay.Next` is the receive that waits the same way (§5).
- Boundaries (Tin 1, notes/interface_boundaries.md): each request task has a root boundary
  record under its core's root, holding its deadline and cancel state; block boundaries nest
  under it. `rt_bnd_cancel(b, reason)` cancels `b` and everything inside it (never its parent
  or siblings) and ends the waits of the tasks inside: `rt_task_wait` returns `waitDeadline`,
  and a wait in a boundary that is already cancelled returns it at once. Clients then fail
  with `rt_wait_fault()`: the reason itself when it is `fault.DeadlineExceeded` or
  `fault.LimitExceeded` (by identity), otherwise a `fault.Canceled` fault reading
  `canceled: <reason>` whose cause is the reason (notes/interface_faults.md).
  `tools/ci/cancel_check.py` checks every client.
- Deadlines (#233, edition 1): `within d { }` enters a `bkWithin` boundary whose deadline is
  the earlier of `now + d` and the enclosing one (the request's `TIN_DEADLINE_MS`, an outer
  `within`); waits past it fail with `fault.DeadlineExceeded`, which the block gives as its
  fault. `task.Deadline()` is the effective deadline of the running code (`tide.Now()`
  nanoseconds, 0 for none) and `task.Canceled()` the fault its next wait would fail with (nil
  while it may go on), for code that does not wait or wants to stop at a point of its own.
- `once { ... }` (#236) runs its block the first time each core reaches it (globals are per
  core, so this is the unit; process-wide one-time work belongs in `on app.start`).
- Arenas (#236, edition 1, notes/interface_arena.md): `arena { }` is `arena$N(c)`, which
  opens a `bkArena` boundary with a fresh pool (`rt_arena_open`), runs the block's closure
  (`rt_arena_run`), gives the context the parent pool back (`rt_arena_out`), copies the fault
  (`rt_arena_fault`) and the value (a generated `arenacopy$N`, the pool twin of `keep$N`)
  into it, and frees the arena's chunks (`rt_arena_close`). The record's `bRegion` points to
  the arena's saved pool words. A pool's words have one home while its code is not running:
  `rt_arena_open` writes the parent's back to theirs first, so scope children that share the
  parent's pool keep allocating in it while the arena body waits, and `rt_task_run` keeps a
  task's arena pool in its innermost arena (`rt_pool_home`). An unwind that passes through
  an arena frees it: `rt_land` (guard, limit and within landings, with the landing fault
  copied out first) and `rt_bnd_task_end` (a task ended by panic, with a scope child's fault
  copied out). Its chunks charged to a `limit` are given back.
- Budgets (#235): `limit memory n, tasks k { }` counts the pool chunks and big blocks taken
  inside it (the bump fast path is not touched) and tasks started in it. Passing the memory
  budget leaves the block with `fault.LimitExceeded` at once (its defers and cleanups run).
  `TIN_REQUEST_MEMORY` (bytes, beyond a request's first pool chunk) bounds every request the
  same way; a request past it ends with 500 and the server goes on. Unset, it is a quarter of
  the memory limit per core, at least 64 MiB (#356; 0 turns it off).
- Scopes (Tin 1 #232, edition 1): `scope s { s.spawn(fn() ! { ... }) }`. A child is a task
  on the same core with a root boundary under the scope's; it runs when its parent waits,
  allocates in its parent's pool (children share the parent's region) and may store request
  memory in what it captures. The scope's end waits for every child; the first child fault
  cancels the scope, and so its other children, and is the scope's fault (`try` passes it
  on). `let t = s.spawn(f)` gives a handle with `t.wait() !` and `t.cancel()`; a child cancelled
  through its handle does not fail the scope. `s.cancel(reason)` (#143) cancels the scope by
  hand: every wait inside it, its children's and its body's, fails with `canceled: reason`
  (`fault.Is(err, fault.Canceled)`), and that is the scope's fault unless a child failed first.
  `s.yield()` lets the core's other ready tasks run before the caller goes on (in `main`, one
  of them). A child with a value (`s.spawn(fn() !T { ... })`)
  gives a `spawnedOf[T]` whose `t.wait() !T` is its value or its fault (waiting again gives the
  same value), usable in `select` like any handle. Leaving a scope body early, by `return` or
  a `try`'s fault, cancels and joins the children still running, then leaves the scope. In a server the event loop resumes children;
  in `main` the scope's end runs them itself. Spawned closures make their captured variables
  cells per spawn, so `for i in 0..n { let k = i; s.spawn(...) }` gives each child its own `k`.
  A handle (`spawned`, `spawnedOf[T]`) and its scope cannot outlive the scope block, which frees the
  children's records: the compiler keeps them in local variables and parameters (and local
  slices, maps and optionals of them), never in a global, a field, a result, a type argument
  or a `dyn` value; a value goes only into a variable declared inside its scope (an assignment,
  a `mut` or scope argument, `append`, `copy`); a closure that may be kept, and `detach`, cannot
  capture one; a child of scope `a` cannot capture a handle of a scope inside `a`; and a
  `defer` inside a scope cannot use one. Any number of tasks may wait for one handle.
- `detach { ... }` (#232) starts a task in the core's background boundary: it has its own pool,
  outlives the request that started it (its closure and captures are `keep`-copied to the
  long-lived heap), runs when the event loop turns, is cancelled by the drain with the rest of
  the core, and logs its fault (`detached task failed: ...`) instead of passing it on.
  What it captures must already be long-lived, as for a global: a capture that may hold
  request memory is a compile error naming it, unless the block reads it only inside `keep()`
  (`detach { flush(keep(event)) }`); otherwise keep it first (`let e = keep(event)`). A task
  handle or a scope cannot be captured at all.
- `select { let x = l.Recv() => ...; t.wait() => ...; after(d) => ...; canceled() => ... }`
  (#232) checks its arms in source order, so ties go to the first one; with none ready it
  watches every source (lanes and task handles wake it), parks until one does or the earliest
  `after` comes, withdraws, and checks again. The winning arm then takes its value, which
  cannot wait. A cancelled boundary with no `canceled()` arm ends the select with its fault.
- `use` and `on` (#238, edition 1). A package-level `use db = open()` is a per-core global
  opened with the core's other globals, on core 0 and on every core `hearth.Run` starts (not on
  helper threads); a fault there ends the process with `startup failed: use db: <msg>` and
  status 1. `on app.start`, `on core.start`, `on core.stop` and `on app.stop` handlers run in
  declaration order, each inside a guard under the core's background boundary (no bindings),
  on the core's own stack, so a wait in one blocks its core (which serves nothing then). Order:
  core 0's globals and uses, `app.start`, core 0's `core.start`, `main`; each other core opens
  its uses and runs `core.start` before any core serves (a startup barrier in `hearth.Run`).
  A fault (or a panic) in a start handler ends startup with status 1. When a core's entry
  returns (after the drain), it runs `core.stop` and closes its uses, last opened first; after
  `main` returns, core 0 does the same and then runs `app.stop`. Stop handlers get a fresh
  core root, so the drain's cancellation does not stop their own waits; their faults are logged.
  A function-level `use x = e` is `let x = try e` plus a deferred `x.Close()` (it also runs
  while a panic unwinds); a fault from `Close` is joined after the function's own fault.
  `anvil.Drain(d)` starts the same graceful shutdown as SIGTERM from code, with grace `d`.
- Admission (#238, design_semantics §11). `anvil.Admit(p)` (before `Serve`) sets a policy that
  decides each new request after the built-in limits and before its handler runs, on the core
  it arrived on: `p(anvil.Load)` sees that core's waiting request tasks, live connections, bytes
  buffered for requests still arriving, the requests refused so far, the request-pool bytes its
  requests hold beyond their first chunks (`Pool`) and the bytes its ingot heap holds (`Ingot`,
  #356). `false` answers 503
  with `Retry-After: 1` from static bytes (no allocation, no handler) and keeps the connection
  when the client does. The first refusal on any core makes the server OVERLOADED and runs the
  `on server.overload` handlers; once every shedding core has admitted a request at least a
  second after its last refusal, the `on server.recovered` handlers run. These run in a
  detached task of the core that saw the transition, so a wait in one does not hold the core.
- Tasks can wait on each other: `rt_task_park(timeout)` waits until another task calls
  `rt_task_wake(t)`; woken tasks go on a per-core ready queue that the loop drains on its
  next turn (it does not block while the queue has tasks). `rt_task_defer()` puts the
  running task on that queue, so it continues after the core's other events of this turn.

### Clients on shared connections: redis (v0.4)

- Each core keeps one connection per `redis.Client`. A command is encoded straight into
  the connection's output buffer and a slot for its replies joins a FIFO.
- One task at a time owns the connection's I/O. The owner first defers (`rt_task_defer`),
  so the other requests of the same event-loop turn add their commands; then it writes
  everything queued in one `write`, reads, and hands each complete reply (checked with
  `resp_len`, copied into the slot in malloc'd memory) to the slot at the front, waking its
  task. When its own replies are in, it passes ownership to the first task still waiting.
  Each woken task parses its reply into its own pool.
- A caller that hits its deadline or timeout marks its slot gone and leaves; the slot stays
  queued so the reply that comes later is consumed in order and freed. A connection error
  fails every waiting slot; the next command reconnects. An idle connection is checked
  with a non-blocking `recv(MSG_PEEK)` before use, so a server restart costs no failures.
- TLS (#124): `Options.TLS`, or a `rediss://` URL, connects over TLS 1.3. The server name is
  `Addr`'s host unless `TLS.ServerName` is set, and the certificate is verified unless
  `InsecureSkipVerify`. Not yet: session resumption (every connection does a full handshake).

### Upgraded connections: websocket (v0.4)

- `Req.Hijack` takes a request's connection out of HTTP: anvil writes the responses queued
  before it, removes the descriptor from the core's poller (so the task can watch it with
  `rt_task_wait`), clears the request deadline and defers once, so the request always ends
  through `finish_request`, which then closes the descriptor instead of answering.
  Hijacked connections do not count toward the 4096 waiting requests per core.
- `websocket.Accept` checks the handshake, hijacks and writes the 101 itself. The
  connection's state belongs to its caller's pool; heap-owned I/O buffers are released
  by `Close` or automatically before the owning task/scope resets. Repeated `Close`
  is safe. An idle connection parks its request task and occupies no thread.
- Tasks on one core may write to the same `Conn`: a frame is written whole before
  the next writer, who waits its turn with `rt_task_defer`.
- `Conn.Each(h)` gives every message callback a reusable pool, reset after the callback
  returns; use `keep()` to retain message data. Objects allocated before `Each`,
  including the Conn, remain valid, and callbacks may wait. Read/callback faults are
  copied into the caller's pool before the scope is released. The echo example uses
  `Each`, so memory use stays bounded for a long-lived stream.
- `Read` continues to return data in the caller's pool, preserving earlier messages
  across later reads. Its fragment accumulator is temporary heap memory, freed on
  every return, and ping/pong payloads are processed in place without pool allocations.
  Client masking keys are generated directly into the frame header. `Read` users who
  retain all messages must manage their pool lifetime explicitly; `Each` is the stream
  API that supplies a safe per-message lifetime.

### TLS connections: tls (#124)

- `tls.Dial` connects with `wire` and runs the TLS 1.3 handshake on the socket; `tls.Client`
  runs it over a `wire.Conn` that already exists. All I/O is the socket's non-blocking
  `read`/`write` with `rt_task_wait` on `EAGAIN`, as for `wire`, so a handshake or a read waits
  without holding the core; `Config.Timeout` bounds connect plus handshake, `SetTimeout` each
  later wait, `SetDeadline` all of them, and a request's deadline or cancellation ends any of
  them with `rt_wait_fault()`. The CPU work of a handshake (one X25519 or P-256 operation,
  key derivation) runs on the core.
- Memory: a `Conn` makes its record buffers (16 KiB + 256 bytes in, 16 KiB of decrypted data)
  at the handshake and afterwards changes only in place: KeyUpdate rewrites the AEAD's keys
  with `seal.AEAD.Rekey`, IVs and secrets are copied into the slices it has. So a `Conn` is
  valid in whatever region holds it: the request pool for `wire.Get`, the caller's pool for a
  `websocket` client (whose per-message pools come and go under it), or `keep()`'s heap for a
  client that keeps connections across requests. Each `Read` or `Write` allocates its
  temporaries (a record's ciphertext or plaintext) in the current pool.
- Records: at most 16 KiB of plaintext; writes are sealed and sent in one `write`. After
  2^24 records under one key the client sends KeyUpdate itself. Alerts are sent encrypted
  once the handshake keys exist; a fatal alert or fault closes the socket and every later
  call returns the same fault.
- Verification is on by default and cannot be turned off by accident: until X.509 lands
  (phase 2), `verify_peer` refuses every server unless `InsecureSkipVerify` is set.
- The database clients keep each connection's `tls.Conn` in a per-core global (`tlsLines` by
  client in redis, `tlsConns` by connection record in mysql and postgres) as a `keep()` copy:
  replacing or deleting the entry when a connection is dropped releases its memory through the
  long-lived reference counts (#176). Their own non-blocking loops read with
  `tls.Conn.ReadNow`, which returns 0 instead of waiting (and never while TLS holds data), then
  wait on the descriptor as before, so a caller that times out leaves the connection in step;
  writes go through `Write`, which waits inside tls (a record is never half sent), and a failed
  TLS write drops the connection.
- `wire.DoWith` takes `https://` (port 443 by default) with `Options.TLS`; the response reader
  is generic over a private `stream` shape, so the same code reads a `wire.Conn` and a
  `tls.Conn`. `websocket.Dial` takes `wss://` (`DialTLS` with a `tls.Config`): the
  connection's `fill` and `write_raw` go through the `tls.Conn` held in its state.

### Pooled clients: mysql (v0.4)

- MySQL answers one statement at a time per connection, so each core keeps a pool per
  `mysql.Client` (`Options.Pool`, default `max(2, 64/cores)`). A task takes an idle connection
  (checked with `MSG_PEEK`), dials a new one while under the limit, or parks in the pool's
  FIFO; a released connection goes straight to the first waiter still waiting.
- `Options.MaxTotal` caps the connections of the whole process (every core's Client with the
  same address, user, database and cap shares one counter, an atomic compare-and-swap). A core
  at the cap with an idle connection of another core available takes that slot: it shuts the
  socket down under a lock (the server sees the close at once) and the owner frees the record
  when it next pops it, so no descriptor number is reused under a core that still holds it. With
  every connection busy the task looks again every 2 ms until its deadline. The server's own
  count can run a connection or two over the cap while it notices a close.
- `redis.Client` keeps one connection per core and has no pool to size.
- The task that holds a connection does its I/O directly (`rt_task_wait` on `EAGAIN`) and
  builds rows in its own pool. A server error (an ERR packet) leaves the connection usable;
  an I/O error, a timeout or the deadline closes it, since its state is unknown.
- A query with values runs as a prepared statement (`COM_STMT_PREPARE` once per text and
  connection, then `COM_STMT_EXECUTE` with binary parameters and rows); one without values
  as `COM_QUERY`. Up to 256 statements are cached per connection.
- Login: `caching_sha2_password` (fast path, or the full exchange: the server's RSA public
  key, fetched once per Client, encrypts the password with `seal.EncryptOAEPSha1`) and
  `mysql_native_password`, including auth-switch requests.
- TLS (#124): `Options.TLS` sends SSLRequest (`CLIENT_SSL`) and runs TLS 1.3 on the socket
  before the login. The server name is `Addr`'s host unless `TLS.ServerName` is set, and the
  certificate is verified unless `InsecureSkipVerify`. Over TLS the full
  `caching_sha2_password` exchange sends the password itself (no RSA key is fetched). Not
  yet: session resumption.

### Routing: Router

}

fn missing(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
}
-->
```tin body
let r = anvil.NewRouter()
let v2 = anvil.NewRouter()
r.Use(logged)                                  // middleware, around every route below
r.Get(`/users/{id}`, user)                     // patterns with {...} are raw strings
r.Get(`/static/{path...}`, files)              // the rest of the path; * is the same, named "*"
r.Route("/admin", fn(g mut anvil.Router) {     // a group: a new router mounted at /admin
	g.Use(auth)
	g.Delete(`/users/{id}`, remove)
})
r.Mount("/v2", v2)                             // another router's routes under /v2
r.NotFound(missing)                            // the status is already 404
try r.Serve(":8080")                           // fails first if a pattern is bad (r.Check)
```

**Matching.**
- A pattern is a path split at `/`: a static segment matches itself, `{name}` any one
  non-empty segment, and a last `{name...}` or `*` the rest of the path, possibly empty
  (`/static/` matches it, `/static` does not). A trailing slash is part of the path:
  `/users` and `/users/` are different routes, and no redirect is made.
- Segment by segment, a static child is tried first, then the `{name}` child, then the
  catch-all, going back when a branch has no route for the rest of the path; so
  `/users/new` beats `/users/{id}` whatever the order of registration, and
  `/users/new/posts/3` still reaches `/users/{id}/posts/{post}`.
- The method takes part: a node only matches with a route for the request's method, then
  GET's for a HEAD request (the body is dropped when written), then `Any`'s. When no route
  matches but routes take the path with other methods, the answer is 405 with `Allow`
  (their names in order, HEAD wherever GET is); otherwise 404.
- Static segments are compared with the path as sent (still %-encoded). `q.PathParam` reads
  the matched segment, %-decoded (`%2F` gives `/` inside one parameter, `+` stays `+`), and
  `q.Pattern()` the route's whole pattern, for logs and metrics.
- Errors are found before serving (`r.Check()`, `Serve`, `Run`): a pattern not starting
  with `/`, a brace inside a static segment, a catch-all before the end, a bad or repeated
  parameter name, a bad method, two routes for the same method whose patterns match the
  same paths (`/users/{id}` and `/users/{uid}`), a mount prefix that ends in `/` or a
  catch-all, two routers mounted at the same prefix, and a router mounted inside itself.

**Groups and middleware.**
- A mounted router's patterns are its prefix plus its own (`""` is the prefix itself), and
  its chain is the outer routers' middleware, then its own, in the order added; `Use`
  covers every route of its router, whenever it is called.
- A miss is answered by the deepest router (scope) whose prefix starts the path, through
  that router's chain, with its `NotFound` / `MethodNotAllowed` handler or the nearest one
  around it (defaults: `Not Found`, `Method Not Allowed`).
- Middleware is a top-level function `fn(Req, mut Out, next fn(Req, mut Out))`; a
  middleware is not a closure, so `next` is one anvil function, and the chain's position lives in the
  `Out` (`ep`, the endpoint, and `ci`, the next middleware). A middleware may skip `next`,
  call it more than once, or wait before or after it. It hands data to later handlers with
  `w.SetValue(key, value)` / `w.Value(key)`, a list made on first use in the request's pool.

**The table.**
- Routers are built in `main` (request-pool memory) or by a function a global's initializer
  calls. `Serve` compiles one into an `rtable`: a flat trie (nodes, with indexes for children
  so the type is not recursive and `keep` can copy it), the endpoints (handler, middleware
  chain, pattern, parameter names and segments), one scope per router, and the method names
  (codes 0–8 for GET … TRACE, the others after them; masks hold up to 63).
- The table is `keep`ed into core 0's ingot heap and published in the process-wide (`shared`) global `gRoutes`
  before the cores start; no core writes it afterwards. `run_request` calls
  `dispatch(gRoutes)` instead of the handler, which sets `q.ep` (for `PathParam` and
  `Pattern`) and starts the chain. Matching reads the path in place and allocates nothing.
- Static children are scanned when a node has up to 8, else found through an FNV-1a hash
  table; the method code comes from a switch on the first byte.
- `Run(method, target, body)` and `Match(method, path)` serve tests on the calling thread.
  They reuse their compiled table until any router changes (a per-core counter that every
  change bumps).
- Cost (bench/router, Apple M4 Pro): 15–25 ns per lookup with 1, 20 or 200 routes (chi:
  33–65 ns); 38–49 ns for a whole `Run` (chi's ServeHTTP: 176–212 ns). Served on one core
  with 16 pipelined requests per write, routing adds 10–15 ns of CPU to the 516 ns a request
  takes (see PERFORMANCE.md).

### Pooled clients: postgres

- `postgres.Client` keeps a FIFO pool per core (`Options.Pool`, default `max(2, 64/cores)`;
  `Options.MaxTotal` caps the process, as for mysql). Socket
  buffers and the 256-entry named statement cache are heap-owned; returned rows live
  in the calling task's pool. Idle sockets are checked with nonblocking `MSG_PEEK`.
  Waiters park, and a failed dial or a dropped connection wakes the next waiter to retry.
- Parameters use Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync with binary int8, float8, text, bool
  and bytea encodings. The cache keys on SQL **and parameter OIDs**. At capacity a cache
  miss closes the named statements and drains Sync before rebuilding the cache.
  Queries without values use the simple protocol and may contain multiple statements;
  Query returns the first rowset, Exec the last command's affected count, and both drain
  all replies. Use `INSERT ... RETURNING id` with Query for generated IDs.
- Result format is text, decoded using RowDescription OIDs: int2/4/8 and bool produce
  `Value.Int` (booleans are 0/1), float4/8 produce `Value.Float`, NULL produces `Value.Null`.
  Other OIDs produce `Value.Text`, including numeric, bytea, date/time, uuid and json/jsonb.
  Bytea is the server's text representation (normally `\x` followed by hexadecimal).
- ErrorResponse/NoticeResponse fields are parsed with bounded cursors. SQL errors retain
  the connection only after ReadyForQuery is consumed; I/O faults, malformed messages,
  timeouts and request deadlines drop it. `Options.Timeout` is one absolute budget for
  acquiring, connecting/authenticating, preparing and executing a statement, so notices
  and repeated reads cannot restart it. The earlier request deadline also applies.
- Begin pins a connection; SQL failure leaves it aborted until Rollback. Commit refuses
  an aborted transaction instead of reporting PostgreSQL's implicit rollback as success.
  Tx copies share state, so finishing one finishes all copies. Unfinished transactions
  are dropped at the owning request/scope's end; outside tasks finish explicitly.
- Authentication supports SCRAM-SHA-256, legacy MD5 and cleartext. SCRAM checks the nonce,
  iteration bounds and server verifier, and applies Unicode 3.2 SASLprep with PostgreSQL's
  fallback to original password bytes on invalid UTF-8/prohibited input. The fixed tables
  in `lib/postgres/sasl/sasl.tin` are regenerated by `tools/gen_saslprep.py` using Python's
  built-in Unicode 3.2 database. `seal.Pbkdf2Sha256` and its Timeout form reuse a nested allocation pool across
  rounds, yielding between batches and honoring request/operation deadlines.
- TLS (#124): `Options.SSLMode` "require" sends SSLRequest and runs TLS 1.3 without checking
  the certificate; "verify-full", the default when `Options.TLS` is set, also checks the
  certificate and the server name (`Addr`'s host unless `TLS.ServerName` is set). "" without
  `Options.TLS` is "disable"; an unknown mode is refused, and no mode falls back to plain TCP.
  A server that requires TLS while the mode is "disable" fails with a message naming
  `Options.SSLMode`. Not yet: SCRAM channel binding (`SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS`) and session
  resumption.
- CancelRequest is not sent;
  a timed-out query loses its connection and the server detects that disconnect.

### Recording requests for replay (#241)

A server records requests so that a failure seen in production can be replayed later with
`tin replay` (#242). The design is `notes/design_semantics.md` §12, and the names and byte
layouts are in `notes/interface_replay.md`.

- **Switches**, read once before the cores start. Recording is on when `TIN_REPLAY_DIR`
  (the spool directory) and `TIN_REPLAY_KEY` (64 hex digits) are both set. A malformed key
  prints one line on stderr and leaves recording off. `TIN_REPLAY_SAMPLE` (0 to 1) is the
  fraction of successful requests to keep as well; requests ending in a 5xx or a panic are
  always kept. `TIN_REPLAY_MAX_MB` (default 256) bounds the spool, deleting the oldest
  capsules first. `TIN_REPLAY_SECRET_HEADERS` adds header names to `Authorization`,
  `Proxy-Authorization` and `Cookie`, whose values are stored as keyed handles.
  `TIN_REPLAY_DROP_HEADERS` names headers stored empty.
- **The tape.** Each request task gets a tape, malloc'd and outside the request pool, that
  holds a copy of the request bytes. Scope children share it. Every effect a client
  performs is appended to it in completion order: clocks (`tide`), the request's random
  seed (`dice`), `seal.RandomBytes`, `wire` (HTTP, dial, read, write), `redis`, `mysql`,
  `postgres`, `websocket` and `quarry`. Each record holds its kind, its key (what was
  asked) and its outcome (the result, or the fault with its runtime sentinel). A live call
  runs with the tape suspended, so a client calling itself is recorded once.
- **Secrets never reach a capsule as text.** Secret headers, the values of those headers
  in `wire` keys, and secret values written into query literals (`query.Hidden`) are
  stored as `tin-secret:` and 32 hex digits of HMAC-SHA256 under a key derived from
  `TIN_REPLAY_KEY`. Logins (Redis `AUTH`, database passwords) happen inside the live call
  and are never recorded.
- **Capsules.** When a request task ends, `lib/replay` keeps its tape when the status is
  500 or more, the request panicked, or it is in the sample. The capsule is written on the
  core after the task ended, as `WALL-CORE-N.tcap` in the spool, via a `.tmp` file and a
  rename. The body (the request, the status, the panic message and the effect records) is
  encrypted with an HMAC-SHA256 keystream and authenticated by an HMAC tag, so a wrong key
  or a changed byte is refused.
- **Cost.** Off, each effect call site tests the running task's tape: one per-core load
  and a branch. A request costs one shared load in anvil. On, a request copies its bytes
  once, and each effect appends one record (about 110 ns on a 2.8 GHz x86-64).

## 10. JSON: argo

- `argo.Put(mut b, v)` compiles to a call of a generated encoder `argo$N(b, x)` per type.
  Constant pieces (`{"name":`) become a few word stores. Strings are scanned and copied
  8 bytes at a time with SWAR checks for `"`, `\` and control bytes. Integers are
  written digit by digit, floats via `shortest_into` straight into the buffer.
- `argo.Get(text, mut v)` compiles to a generated decoder `argo$dN(p, x)` over a `Parser`
  (text, offset, depth, first error). The readers (`robj`, `rarr`, `rkey`, `rstr`, `rint`,
  `rintr`, `ruint`, `rfloat`, `rbool`, `rnull`, `rskip`, `rmore`) record the first
  error and then do nothing, so decoders test the error only at loop boundaries.
  Strings without escapes are returned as substrings without copying.
- `rskip` and the decoders of recursive types take a stack frame per nesting level
  (32 bytes for `rskip`, 80 for a small struct, 240 for one of 32 fields), so `robj` and
  `rarr` fault once 512 arrays and objects are open: even 240-byte frames then fit in
  half of a 256 KiB task stack.

## 11. Startup sequence of a strict program

```text
_start (ELF) or dyld (Mach-O) -> main (the generated __start):
  rt_init(argc, argv, number of per-core globals, __core_init)
  shared (process-wide) global initializers
  __core_init()               per-core globals of core 0
  rt_main_begin()             allocations now go to the request pool
  main.main()
  rt_exit()                   flush stdout, exit(0)
```

## 12. Cryptography: constant-time code in seal

TLS (#124) needs primitives whose running time and memory accesses do not depend on secret
data. The rule in `lib/seal/`: no branch, loop bound or table index depends on a secret byte
(key, plaintext, shared secret, MAC); lengths and public inputs may. The list below says which
functions keep that rule, and grows as phase 1 lands.

| function | constant-time in | not constant-time in |
|---|---|---|
| `Sha256`, `Sha384`, `Sha512`, `Sum` | the message bytes | its length |
| `tls`: record protection, the Finished check (`ConstantTimeEq`), the key schedule | keys, secrets, data and MACs | lengths, and the padding length of a received record |
| `Hmac`, `HmacSha256` | the key and message bytes | their lengths |
| `HkdfExtract`, `HkdfExpand`, `HkdfExpandLabel` | the key material | lengths, `info`, labels |
| `ConstantTimeEq`, `Equal` | the bytes | the lengths |
| `X25519`, `X25519PublicKey` | the scalar and the point (ladder with masked swaps; ten-limb field) | the final all-zero check, whose result is public |
| `ChaCha20`, `AEAD.Seal` and `AEAD.Open` for ChaCha20-Poly1305 | the key, the data and the tag (the tag is compared with `ConstantTimeEq`) | the lengths |
| `NewAESGCM`, `AEAD.Seal` and `AEAD.Open` for AES-GCM: on the CPU's AES-NI/PCLMULQDQ or ARMv8 AESE/AESMC/PMULL instructions when it has them (`selfhost/aes_hw.tin`), else bitsliced AES with the S-box as GF(2^8) inversion and GHASH by multiplication with holes | the key, the data and the tag | the lengths, and which path the CPU allows |
| `P256PublicKey`, `P256ECDH` and the field and point code under them (`field.tin`, `p256.tin`) | the private key and every coordinate | the validity checks of the key and the peer's point, whose results are public |

| `monty_new` (`bignum.tin`: Montgomery constants for a modulus given at run time) | the modulus's value | its limb count and bit length |
| `SignPKCS1v15`, `SignPSS` (`rsa_sign.tin`: CRT, base blinding by r^e, r^-1 by Fermat inversion in each prime, a public-key check of every signature) and `monty_exp_ct`, `monty_reduce`, `nat_mul_ct` under them | the private key, the message representative and r | the key's size; PSS's salt is random and public |
| `SignECDSA`, `PrivateKey.SignTLS` (`ecdsa_sign.tin`: RFC 6979 nonces by `Hmac`, k·G by `p256_mul` or `ec_mul_ct`, k^-1 as k^(n-2) with the public exponent) | the private scalar and the nonce | the digest, and the (negligibly rare, public) retry when a nonce candidate is not below n |
| `ParsePrivateKeyPEM`, `ParsePrivateKeyDER` | nothing: the key's encoding (lengths, tags) is parsed with ordinary branches | |

`Sha1`, `Pbkdf2Sha256`, the hex and base64 codecs and the RSA-OAEP code are not
constant-time and must not be used on secrets in a timing-sensitive protocol path.
`TIN_SEAL_SOFT=1` in the environment makes AES-GCM use the software path even on a CPU with
the instructions (for tests).

Signature verification and certificates (#124 phase 2) see only public data and are not
constant-time by design: `VerifyPKCS1v15`, `VerifyPSS`, `VerifyECDSA` (and `p384.tin`'s
curve code, used only for it), `VerifyEd25519`, `ParseCertificate`, `DecodePEM`,
`Certificate.Verify`, `CheckSignature`, `CheckTLSSignature` and `VerifyHostname`.
Certificate policy: a chain is built from the leaf through `VerifyOptions.Intermediates` to
`Roots` (default: the system bundle, read once per core from the paths in
`roots_linux.tin`/`roots_darwin.tin` or `SSL_CERT_FILE`); every certificate must be within its
validity period, intermediates must be CAs (basic constraints) allowed to sign certificates
(key usage), path lengths, extended key usages and DNS/IP name constraints hold, signatures
use SHA-256/384/512 (SHA-1 is refused) with RSA keys of 2048 to 8192 bits, ECDSA P-256/P-384 or Ed25519, no certificate
has an unhandled critical extension, and the chain holds at most `MaxChain` (8) certificates.
Host names follow RFC 6125: DNS SANs only (the common name is ignored), one leftmost `*`
label over at least two more labels, IP literals against IP SANs. The parser is strict DER and
rejects every certificate Go's `crypto/x509` rejects (`tools/ci/x509_check.py` checks this on
byte-flipped certificates).
the instructions (for tests). Vectors: `tools/ci/crypto_check.py` runs the Wycheproof files in `tests/wycheproof/`
(including the invalid inputs) and random inputs checked against Python's `hashlib`.
