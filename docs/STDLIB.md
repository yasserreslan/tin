## say

Built into the compiler (formatting by static type, no reflection): `say.Line(a, b...)`, `say.Text(...)`, `say.Out(format, ...)`, `say.Fmt(format, ...) str`, `say.Str(x) str`, `say.Fault(format, ...) fault`, `say.To(fd, ...)`, `say.LineTo(fd, ...)`. See docs/LANGUAGE.md.

## fault

Package fault is fault chains and the standard sentinels, like Go's errors package: Wrap adds context and keeps the cause, Is walks the chain comparing identity, Join keeps several faults reachable. The runtime's sentinels are the variables Canceled, DeadlineExceeded, LimitExceeded, Overloaded, Draining and Panic; a package declares its own as `var ErrX = fault("msg")`. A function that makes a fault is declared ! here: its fault is the value (fail it, keep it in a variable, or test it). Layout and identities: notes/interface_faults.md.

- `Wrap(err fault, msg str) !`: Wrap is err with msg in front ("msg: cause"), err reachable as its cause; nil when err is nil.
- `Is(err fault, target fault) bool`: Is reports whether err or a fault in its chain (causes and joined faults) is target: the same sentinel, or the same fault.
- `Cause(err fault) !`: Cause is the fault err wraps; nil when it wraps none (and for nil and a Join).
- `Join(errs []fault) !`: Join is one fault holding every non-nil fault of errs, each reachable by Is, the messages on separate lines; nil when all are nil.
- `Message(err fault) str`: Message is the full message of err ("outer: inner" for a wrapped fault), "" for nil.
- `Backtrace(err fault) str`: Backtrace is the backtrace text of the panic in err's chain (a fault.Panic), "" for none.

## argo

Package argo writes JSON. argo.Put(b, v) appends v to the []u8 buffer b; the compiler generates a dedicated encoder for v's type (fields in declaration order, no reflection, no allocation). The w* writers below are what those encoders call. argo.Get(s, v) fills v from the JSON text s with a decoder generated the same way; it returns a fault for arrays and objects nested more than 512 deep, as each level takes stack.

- `Put(b mut []u8, v i64)`: Put appends v as JSON to b. The compiler replaces every call with a typed encoder.
- `Str(b mut []u8, s str)`: Str appends s as a JSON string.
- `Raw(b mut []u8, s str)`: Raw appends already-encoded JSON text.
- `type Parser struct`

## io

Package io declares the streaming shapes: a type satisfies Reader, Writer, Closer or Seeker by having the methods, with no declaration, and compositions like ReadWriteCloser by satisfying every listed shape. The helpers (Copy, ReadAll, Pipe, MultiWriter, ...) and EOF as a sentinel fault land with the io port (roadmap #141); the byte, rune and string shapes (ByteReader, RuneReader, StringWriter, ...) and Go's ReaderFrom and WriterTo (which need dyn) are not declared yet.

- `shape Reader { Read(buf mut []u8) !i64 }`: Reader is anything with Read: it fills buf and returns how many bytes it wrote.
- `shape Writer { Write(data []u8) !i64 }`: Writer is anything with Write: it takes data and returns how many bytes it took.
- `shape Closer { Close() !i64 }`: Closer is anything with Close.
- `shape Seeker { Seek(offset i64, whence i64) !i64 }`: Seeker is anything with Seek: offset is relative to whence (0 start, 1 current, 2 end).
- `shape ReaderAt { ReadAt(buf mut []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: ReaderAt is a reader that does not move a position: it reads at off.
- `shape WriterAt { WriteAt(data []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: WriterAt is a writer that does not move a position: it writes at off.
- `shape ReadWriter`: ReadWriter reads and writes.
- `shape ReadCloser`: ReadCloser reads and closes.
- `shape WriteCloser`: WriteCloser writes and closes.
- `shape WriteSeeker`: WriteSeeker writes and seeks.
- `shape ReadSeekCloser`: ReadSeekCloser reads, seeks and closes.
- `shape ReadWriteCloser`: ReadWriteCloser reads, writes and closes.
- `shape ReadSeeker`: ReadSeeker reads and seeks.
- `shape ReadWriteSeeker`: ReadWriteSeeker reads, writes and seeks.

## anvil

Package anvil is an HTTP/1.1 server: one event loop per core (kqueue), share-nothing.

Core 0 accepts connections and deals them round-robin to every core through a pipe; from then on a connection belongs to one core for its whole life. Each core reads into one scratch buffer, parses requests in place, runs the handler, writes every response of the batch with one write, and wipes its request pool. Idle connections hold no buffers, only a 96-byte record.

```go
func handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	w.Type("application/json")
	argo.Put(mut w.Body, Msg{message: "hi"})
}
func main() {
	err := anvil.Serve(":8080", handle)
	say.Line("server:", err)
}
```

A Router picks the handler by method and path pattern, and runs middleware around it. Patterns match whole segments: "users" itself, {id} any one non-empty segment, and a last {path...} or * the rest of the path. Static segments win over {name}, and {name} over the rest, segment by segment, whatever the order of registration. A path whose routes take other methods gets 405 with Allow, any other miss 404; HEAD falls back to GET. A trailing slash is part of the path: /users/ and /users are different routes. Write patterns with {...} as raw strings: in "..." the braces would interpolate.

```go
func user(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	id := q.PathParam("id")
	w.Text("user {id}")
}
func logged(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out, next func(anvil.Req, mut anvil.Out)) {
	next(q, mut w)
	say.Line(q.Method, q.Pattern(), w.Code())
}
func main() {
	r := anvil.NewRouter()
	r.Use(logged)
	r.Get(`/users/{id}`, user)
	r.Route("/admin", func(g mut anvil.Router) {
		g.Use(auth)
		g.Delete(`/users/{id}`, remove)
	})
	err := r.Serve(":8080")
	say.Line("server:", err)
}
```

- `type Req struct`: Req is the request being served. Its strings live in the request pool: keep() them to store them anywhere long-lived.
- `type Out struct`: Out is the response being built. Body is the response body; the status defaults to 200 and the content type to text/plain.
- `Serve(addr str, h func(Req, mut Out)) !`: Serve listens on addr (":8080", "127.0.0.1:8080") and serves h on every core. It returns only if the server cannot start. TIN_CORES overrides the number of cores.
- `ServeN(addr str, n i64, h func(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `Timeouts(header i64, read i64, idle i64, write i64)`: Timeouts sets the connection timeouts in milliseconds; 0 turns one off. header: a request's line and headers must arrive within it (slowloris); read: the whole request, body included; idle: a keep-alive connection with no request in progress; write: a response the client stops reading (no progress for this long). A connection is closed when one passes; a request whose handler is running is governed by Deadline instead. Defaults 10000, 60000, 60000 and 30000; TIN_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_READ_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS and TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS override them. Call before Serve.
- `Limits(maxBody i64, maxBuffered i64, maxConns i64)`: Limits sets the largest request body in bytes (413 past it), the bytes of requests still arriving that one core may buffer (a new partial request past it gets 503 and close), and the connections per core (more are closed at accept; 0: no limit). Defaults 64 MiB, 256 MiB and 16384; TIN_MAX_BODY, TIN_MAX_BUFFERED and TIN_MAX_CONNS override them. Call before Serve.
- `Deadline(ms i64)`: Deadline makes every request's waits (tide.Wait, client calls) fail with "deadline exceeded" once ms have passed since the request started (0: no deadline; call before Serve). TIN_DEADLINE_MS sets it too; the default is 30000.
- `(q Req) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the value of the request header name (any case), or "".
- `(q Req) Hijack() !i64`: Hijack takes the request's connection out of HTTP for a protocol of its own (the websocket package uses it): the responses before this request are written, the core stops reading the connection and the request's deadline no longer applies. It returns the non-blocking descriptor, for the caller's I/O until the handler returns; then anvil closes it. The handler's Out is not sent.
- `(q Req) Body() str`: Body returns the request body.
- `(q Req) Param(name str) str`: Param returns query parameter name, %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) PathParam(name str) str`: PathParam returns path parameter name of the Router route that matched ({name}, {name...}, or "*" for a last *), %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) Pattern() str`: Pattern returns the pattern of the Router route serving the request ("/users/{id}"), or "" (no Router, or a 404 or 405 answer).
- `(w mut Out) Status(code i64)`: Status sets the response status code.
- `(w mut Out) Type(t str)`: Type sets the Content-Type header. CR, LF and NUL in t become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines.
- `(w mut Out) Head(k str, v str)`: Head adds a response header. A name that is not an HTTP token is ignored, and so are Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding and Connection: anvil writes the framing itself. CR, LF and NUL in the value become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines or a body (response splitting), as Go's net/http does.
- `(w mut Out) Text(s str)`: Text appends s to the body.
- `(w mut Out) Json()`: Json sets the JSON content type; the body is then written with argo.Put(mut w.Body, v).
- `(w Out) Code() i64`: Code returns the response status set so far (200 unless Status changed it).
- `(w Out) Header(k str) str`: Header returns response header k as set so far (Type sets Content-Type, Head the rest), or "".
- `(w mut Out) SetValue(key str, value str)`: SetValue stores value under key for the rest of the request: middleware hand data (a user id, a request id) to the handlers after them this way. Value reads it back.
- `(w Out) Value(key str) str`: Value returns what SetValue stored under key in this request, or "".
- `OnRelay(h func(i64, str))`: OnRelay makes every core run h(from, msg) for each relay message it receives (call before Serve). Handlers run between requests, with their own request pool.
- `OnTick(ms i64, h func(i64))`: OnTick makes every core run h(core) every ms milliseconds (call before Serve).
- `type Router struct`: Router sends each request to the handler routed for its method and path pattern, through the middleware added with Use. Build it in main (or in a function a global's initializer calls), then Serve it, or try requests on it with Run.
- `NewRouter() Router`: NewRouter makes an empty router: every request gets 404 until routes are added.
- `(r mut Router) Get(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Get routes GET requests for pattern to h, and HEAD requests unless Head routes them.
- `(r mut Router) Post(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Post routes POST requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Put(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Put routes PUT requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Patch(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Patch routes PATCH requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Delete(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Delete routes DELETE requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Head(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Head routes HEAD requests for pattern to h (without it, they go to the GET route).
- `(r mut Router) Options(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Options routes OPTIONS requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Handle(method str, pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Handle routes requests with method (any HTTP method name, like "PROPFIND") for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Any(pattern str, h func(Req, mut Out))`: Any routes requests for pattern with every method to h; a route for the request's own method on the same pattern wins over it.
- `(r mut Router) Use(mw func(Req, mut Out, func(Req, mut Out)))`: Use adds middleware mw to r. Middleware run in the order added, around every route of r and of the routers mounted in it, and around their 404 and 405 answers. Each gets next, the rest of the chain, and decides whether and when to call it.
- `(r mut Router) Route(prefix str, build func(mut Router))`: Route groups routes under prefix ("/api"): build adds them to a new router mounted there.
- `(r mut Router) Mount(prefix str, sub Router)`: Mount serves sub's routes under prefix: "/api" and "/users" make "/api/users", and "/api" and "" make "/api". r's middleware run before sub's, and sub's 404 and 405 answers (with its middleware) cover the paths under prefix.
- `(r mut Router) NotFound(h func(Req, mut Out))`: NotFound sets the handler for the paths no route matches (under r's prefix when r is mounted); the status starts as 404.
- `(r mut Router) MethodNotAllowed(h func(Req, mut Out))`: MethodNotAllowed sets the handler for the paths whose routes take other methods; the status starts as 405 and the Allow header lists those methods.
- `(r Router) Check() !`: Check fails with r's first bad pattern, conflicting route or misplaced mount, the error Serve would fail with before listening.
- `(r Router) Serve(addr str) !`: Serve listens on addr and serves r on every core, like anvil.Serve. The routes are checked and compiled once, into a table every core reads; Serve fails with r's error, if any (see Check).
- `(r Router) ServeN(addr str, n i64) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `(r Router) Run(method str, target str, body str) Out`: Run sends one request through r on this thread, as Serve would (middleware, 404, 405), and returns the response: for tests. target is the path and query ("/users/7?full=1"), the request has no headers, and a HEAD response keeps its body. Run panics if r has an error (see Check).
- `(r Router) Match(method str, path str) str`: Match returns the pattern of the route that would serve method and path ("/users/{id}"), or "" when the request would get 404 or 405. Like Run, it panics if r has an error (see Check).

## hearth

Package hearth runs a program on every core: one thread per core, each with its own globals, request pool and ingot heap. Cores share nothing; relay carries messages.

- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of CPUs this program may use: the CPUs online, capped on Linux by the affinity mask (cpuset) and the cgroup CPU quota (ceil of cpu.max quota/period); never 0.
- `MemLimit() i64`: MemLimit is the memory limit in bytes the container (cgroup) imposes: 0 when there is none.
- `ID() i64`: ID is the current core's number: 0 for the main core.
- `Run(n i64, entry func(i64))`: Run starts entry(i) on cores 1..n-1, runs entry(0) here, then waits for every core. Before starting it sizes the request pools to the memory limit and decides whether cores pin themselves to CPUs (only when they map one-to-one onto the allowed CPUs, or TIN_PIN=1).
- `PoolChunk() i64`: PoolChunk is the request pool chunk size in bytes each core uses (after pool_tune).
- `PoolCapacity() i64`: PoolCapacity is the usable size in bytes of this core's current base pool chunk (0 before its first request allocation).
- `Reset()`: Reset ends the current request: the core's pool is emptied for the next one.

## relay

Package relay carries messages between cores, which share no memory. A message is a str copied into the receiving core's inbox (a lock-free multi-producer queue); the receiver gets its own copy in its request pool. Encode structs with argo.Put/argo.Get.

```go
relay.Send(2, "hello")              // from any core
from, msg := relay.Recv()           // on core 2: blocks until a message arrives
```

- `Send(to i64, msg str)`: Send copies msg into core to's inbox; it never blocks.
- `Broadcast(msg str)`: Broadcast sends msg to every other running core.
- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of cores the program started.
- `TryRecv() (i64, str, bool)`: TryRecv returns the next message for this core, if there is one.
- `Recv() (i64, str)`: Recv blocks until a message for this core arrives and returns its sender and text.
- `WakeFD() i64`: WakeFD is this core's wake-up descriptor, for event loops: after it turns readable, call Drain. Arm must be called before the loop blocks.
- `Arm()`: Arm asks senders to wake this core through WakeFD (call just before blocking).
- `Drain(h func(i64, str))`: Drain runs h on every waiting message (event loops call it after WakeFD fires).
- `Received() i64`: Received is how many messages this core has taken from its inbox.
- `Me() i64`: Me is this core's number.

## task

Package task reads the deadline and cancellation of the running code, which belong to its innermost boundary (the request, a `within` or `limit` block, a scope's child; Go's context.Context Deadline and Err, without passing a context). Waits already fail when either stops the code: these are for code that does not wait, or that wants to stop at a point of its own choosing.

- `Deadline() i64`: Deadline is the effective deadline of the running code in tide.Now() nanoseconds (the earliest of its request's and every enclosing within block's), or 0 when it has none.
- `Canceled() !`: Canceled is nil while the running code may go on, else the fault its next wait would fail with: fault.DeadlineExceeded once the deadline has passed, fault.LimitExceeded past a budget, or fault.Canceled wrapping the reason of a cancel or drain.

## wire

Package wire is TCP networking and a small HTTP/1.1 client. Calls block the calling core (servers should use anvil); every connection can carry a read/write timeout.

```go
c := try wire.Dial("127.0.0.1:6379")
try c.Write("PING\r\n")
r := try wire.Get("http://127.0.0.1:8080/json")
```

- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a TCP connection.
- `type Listener struct`: Listener accepts TCP connections.
- `type Resp struct`: Resp is an HTTP response.
- `IsEOF(err fault) bool`: EOF is the fault Read returns at the end of the stream.
- `Dial(addr str) !Conn`: Dial connects to "host:port".
- `DialTimeout(addr str, timeout i64) !Conn`: DialTimeout connects to "host:port", giving up after timeout nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) Fd() i64`: Fd is the connection's descriptor, for clients that do their own I/O on it (it stays non-blocking; Close still closes it).
- `(c mut Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetNoDelay(on bool)`: SetNoDelay turns Nagle's algorithm off (true) or on.
- `(c Conn) Write(s str) !`: Write sends all of s.
- `(c Conn) WriteBytes(b []u8) !`: WriteBytes sends all of b.
- `(c Conn) Read(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: Read appends up to max bytes to buf and returns how many; at the end it returns 0 and EOF.
- `(c Conn) ReadFull(n i64) !str`: ReadFull reads exactly n bytes.
- `(c mut Conn) Close()`: Close closes the connection.
- `Listen(addr str) !Listener`: Listen opens a TCP listener on "host:port" (":0" picks a free port: see Port).
- `(l Listener) Port() i64`: Port is the port the listener is bound to.
- `(l Listener) Accept() !Conn`: Accept waits for the next connection.
- `(l mut Listener) Close()`: Close stops listening.
- `type Options struct`: Options configure one client call (DoWith); the zero value is what Do uses.
- `const DefaultMaxBody = 67108864`: DefaultMaxBody is the largest response body Do accepts (64 MiB, anvil's request limit): a larger one is a fault rather than memory a broken or hostile server can fill.
- `Get(url str) !Resp`: Get fetches url.
- `Post(url str, ctype str, body str) !Resp`: Post sends body with content type ctype to url.
- `Do(method str, url str, headers []str, body str) !Resp`: Do sends one request: headers is a list of name, value pairs. The method and header names must be tokens, and the URL and header values must not hold CR, LF, NUL or other control bytes (the URL no spaces either), or Do fails instead of sending a request an input could have split. Response bodies over DefaultMaxBody fail; DoWith sets a timeout and the limit.
- `DoWith(method str, url str, headers []str, body str, opt Options) !Resp`: DoWith is Do with options: an overall timeout and a response size limit.
- `(r Resp) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the response header name (any case), or "".

## twine

Package twine manipulates UTF-8 strings (like Go's strings), with Unicode case mapping, folding and white space from glyph's tables.

- `Clone(s str) str`: Clone returns a copy of s that shares no memory with it.

- `SplitN(s str, sep str, n i64) []str`: SplitN is Split returning at most n pieces (all when n < 0, none when n == 0).
- `Join(elems []str, sep str) str`: Join concatenates elems with sep between them.
- `Repeat(s str, count i64) str`: Repeat returns s concatenated count times (empty when count <= 0; panics when the length overflows).
- `Count(s str, sub str) i64`: Count returns the number of non-overlapping sub in s (RuneCount+1 when sub is empty).
- `Replace(s str, old str, repl str, n i64) str`: Replace returns s with the first n non-overlapping old replaced by repl (all when n < 0; empty old matches at every rune boundary).
- `ReplaceAll(s str, old str, repl str) str`: ReplaceAll returns s with every non-overlapping old replaced by repl.

- `ContainsAny(s str, chars str) bool`: ContainsAny reports whether any rune of chars occurs in s.
- `Cut(s str, sep str) (str, str, bool)`: Cut splits s around the first sep, returning (before, after, true), or (s, "", false) when absent.
- `type Builder struct`: Builder accumulates bytes; the zero Builder{} is ready to use, NewBuilder preallocates.

## link

Package link parses, builds and resolves URLs, and escapes and unescapes their parts (like Go's net/url). A URL is a struct; its User is an optional (nil when the URL has no userinfo); query parameters are a Values, a small wrapper over map[str][]str whose keys keep insertion order and whose Encode sorts them. Faults carry Go's messages: parse "x": invalid URL escape "%zz".

Path and Fragment are stored decoded; RawPath and RawFragment hold the original encoding when it differs from the default one (EscapedPath and EscapedFragment use them).
- `(u URL) Clone() URL`: Clone returns a copy of u (a plain assignment of a struct shares it).

- `(u URL) Parse(ref str) !URL`: Parse parses ref (which may be relative) in the context of u: Parse then ResolveReference.
- `(u URL) ResolveReference(ref URL) URL`: ResolveReference resolves a URI reference against u as an absolute URI (RFC 3986 section 5.2): ref may be relative or absolute, and u is typically an absolute URL.
- `(u URL) JoinPath(elems []str) URL`: JoinPath returns a copy of u with the elements joined onto its path (cleaned, with a trailing slash kept if the last element had one).

- `Sha256(s secret str) []u8`: Sha256 is the SHA-256 digest of s (32 bytes); s may be secret.
- `Sha256Soft(s str) []u8`: Sha256Soft is SHA-256 in portable code (the reference the hardware path is tested against).

- `Pbkdf2Sha256(password secret str, salt str, iterations i64, length i64) ![]u8`: Pbkdf2Sha256 derives length bytes using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256. Iterations must be positive; length must be between 0 and 1 MiB. Temporary storage is reused between rounds, so memory usage does not grow with iterations. Choose the work factor for your protocol or password policy (this function does not choose one). The password may be secret.
- `Pbkdf2Sha256Timeout(password secret str, salt str, iterations i64, length i64, timeout i64) ![]u8`: Pbkdf2Sha256Timeout derives bytes like Pbkdf2Sha256, with a timeout in nanoseconds (<= 0: no limit). Both forms honor request deadlines and let other tasks run between batches of rounds. Scratch storage is released before any timeout fault returns.

## constraints

Package constraints contains the named generic constraints used by the standard library.

- `shape Any {}`: Any imposes no operations on a type parameter.
- `shape Comparable {}`: Comparable admits values that can be compared by value, including structs and enums whose fields are all comparable. The compiler checks this property at each instantiation.

## policy

Package policy is the with policies (design_semantics §7.1, notes/interface_policy.md): with p { body } calls p.Run(body) inside a boundary of its own, with the block as body. Slots are typed ambient values that Bind binds for a block and the tasks it spawns; Retry, Trace and Cached are the library policies.

- `shape Policy[T constraints.Any] { Run(body func() !T) !T }`: Policy is what with p { body } needs of p: Run runs body (any number of times) and gives the block's value. Run may only call body, or pass it to a function that only calls it.
- `type Slot[T constraints.Any] struct`: Slot is a typed ambient value: with policy.Bind(s, v) { } binds it for the block and the tasks the block spawns.
- `NewSlot[T constraints.Any](name str) Slot[T]`: NewSlot makes a slot named name; declare it once, in a package-level let (one per core).
- `(s Slot[T]) Name() str`: Name is the slot's name.
- `(s Slot[T]) Get() !T`: Get is the value of the innermost Bind of s around the running code; it fails when s is not bound.
- `(s Slot[T]) Bound() bool`: Bound reports whether s is bound around the running code.
- `type BindPolicy[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any] struct`: BindPolicy binds a slot for its block (Bind).
- `Bind[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any](s Slot[V], v V) BindPolicy[V, T]`: Bind is a policy that binds s to v for its block and the tasks the block spawns: with policy.Bind(requestID, id) { }.
- `(b BindPolicy[V, T]) Run(body func() !T) !T`: Run binds the slot on the with block's boundary, then runs body once.
- `type RetryPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: RetryPolicy runs its block again while it fails (Retry).
- `Retry[T constraints.Any](attempts i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Retry is a policy that runs its block up to attempts times while it fails and gives the last fault. A cancellation ends it at once: a cancellation fault from the block is given as it is, and a boundary cancelled (or past its deadline) between attempts gives the cancellation's fault. The block's side effects run again on each attempt.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Backoff(d i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Backoff is r waiting d before the second attempt, and twice as long before each later one.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Run(body func() !T) !T`: Run runs body until it succeeds, attempts runs have failed, or the boundary is cancelled.
- `SetTracer(f func(str, i64, fault))`: SetTracer sends this core's trace spans to f(name, duration in ns, fault or nil) instead of the log.
- `type TracePolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: TracePolicy reports each run of its block (Trace).

- `(c Cache[T]) Len() i64`: Len is the number of entries, fresh or expired.
- `(c mut Cache[T]) Drop(key str)`: Drop removes key's entry.
- `type CachedPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: CachedPolicy answers its block from a cache (Cached).
- `Cached[T constraints.Any](c Cache[T], key str, ttl i64) CachedPolicy[T]`: Cached is a policy that gives the value cached under key while it is younger than ttl (ns), without running its block; otherwise it runs the block and caches a value it gives. Faults are not cached.
- `(p mut CachedPolicy[T]) Run(body func() !T) !T`: Run gives the cached value, or runs body and caches its value.

## redis

Package redis is a Redis client. Commands are queries: in c.Do("SET user:{id} {body}") the values travel as separate arguments, so a value can never change a command.

Each core keeps one connection per Client. The requests a core serves at the same time share it: their commands are written together and the replies matched in order (pipelining), so a busy server makes few system calls per command. Inside a request task a call waits without blocking the core; outside one it blocks.

```go
var cache = redis.Open(redis.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:6379"})
try cache.Set("greeting", "hello")
v, found := try cache.Get("greeting")
```

Blocking commands (BLPOP, SUBSCRIBE, ...) would hold up the commands queued behind them and are not supported.

- `type Reply enum`: Reply is one Redis reply.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client sends commands to one Redis server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(c Client) Do(q query) !Reply`: Do sends one command and returns its reply; an error reply fails.
- `(c Client) Pipe(qs []query) ![]Reply`: Pipe sends commands together and returns their replies in order; error replies come back as Err. The commands go out back to back, so MULTI ... EXEC in one Pipe is atomic.
- `(c Client) Get(key str) !(str, bool)`: Get returns the value at key, and whether there is one.
- `(c Client) Set(key str, value str) !`: Set stores value at key.
- `(c Client) SetEx(key str, value str, ttl i64) !`: SetEx stores value at key for ttl nanoseconds (at least a millisecond).
- `(c Client) Del(key str) !i64`: Del removes key; it returns how many keys it removed (0 or 1).
- `(c Client) Incr(key str) !i64`: Incr adds one to the integer at key and returns the result.
- `(c Client) Expire(key str, ttl i64) !bool`: Expire makes key expire after ttl nanoseconds; false when there is no such key.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.

## mysql

Package mysql is a MySQL client (tested with MySQL 8.0). Statements are queries: in db.Query("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = {id}") the text becomes "... id = ?" and id a bound parameter of a prepared statement, so a value can never change a statement.

Each core keeps a pool of connections per Client (Options.Pool, default 16); a request task waits for a free one without blocking the core. Prepared statements are cached per connection. Authentication: caching_sha2_password (the MySQL 8 default, including the RSA key exchange when the server has no cached entry) and mysql_native_password. TLS is not supported.

```go
var db = mysql.Open(mysql.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:3306", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
rows := try db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = {id}")
for _, r := range rows.Rows {
	say.Line(r[0].Int(), r[1].Text())
}
```

- `type Value enum`: Value is one column of a row.
- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one MySQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(v Value) IsNull() bool`: IsNull reports whether v is NULL.
- `(v Value) Int() i64`: Int is v as an integer (a Text or Float converted, NULL and bad text 0).
- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement and returns its rows.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement and returns what it changed.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin starts a transaction; finish it with Commit or Rollback, or its connection stays out of the pool.
- `(t mut Tx) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement in the transaction and returns its rows.
- `(t mut Tx) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement in the transaction.
- `(t mut Tx) Commit() !`: Commit makes the transaction's changes permanent.
- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes.

## postgres

Package postgres is a PostgreSQL protocol 3.0 client over TCP. Query interpolation binds binary parameters as $1, $2, ...; a plain str cannot be used as SQL. Connections are pooled per core (default 16) and waiting request tasks park without blocking it. Authentication supports SCRAM-SHA-256, MD5 and cleartext. TLS is not supported: use a trusted private network or a local TLS proxy. An SSL-only server is rejected.

```go
var db = postgres.Open(postgres.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:5432", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
rows := try db.Query("INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES ({name}) RETURNING id")
id := rows.Rows[0][0].Int()
```

- `type Value enum`: Value is one column of a row.
- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one PostgreSQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(v Value) IsNull() bool`: IsNull reports whether v is NULL.
- `(v Value) Int() i64`: Int is v as an integer (a Text or Float converted, NULL and bad text 0).
- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query returns the first rowset. With no parameters, multiple statements are allowed and all replies are consumed before returning. Integers and booleans use Value.Int; float4/8 use Value.Float; other OIDs (including numeric and bytea) use Value.Text.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec returns the affected count of the last command. Use Query with RETURNING to obtain generated IDs (PostgreSQL has no connection-wide last insert ID).
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin pins a connection until Commit or Rollback. SQL errors abort the transaction until Rollback. Copies share its state: finishing one finishes them all. In request tasks an unfinished transaction is dropped when its owning task/scope ends. Outside tasks always finish explicitly. Tx and its rows belong to the caller's pool.
- `(t mut Tx) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement in the transaction and returns its first rowset.
- `(t mut Tx) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement in the transaction and returns its affected count.
- `(t mut Tx) Commit() !`: Commit makes the transaction's changes permanent. An aborted transaction must be rolled back explicitly; PostgreSQL's implicit COMMIT-to-ROLLBACK is not success.
- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes and releases its connection.

## websocket

Package websocket is the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455): Accept upgrades an anvil request, Dial connects to a server. Messages are text or binary; pings are answered and fragments joined inside Read. Inside a request task a Read waits without blocking the core, so one core holds many idle connections.

```go
func handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	ws := websocket.Accept(q, mut w) catch _ { return }
	ws.Each(echo) catch _ {}
}
func echo(ws websocket.Conn, m websocket.Message) ! {
	try ws.WriteText("echo: {m.Data}")
}
```

- `type Message struct`: Message is one complete message.
- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a WebSocket connection.
- `Accept(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) !Conn`: Accept completes the opening handshake for request q and takes over its connection. A request that is not a WebSocket handshake gets a 400 (426 for another version) in w and fails. The connection and its buffers close when the handler returns.
- `Dial(url str) !Conn`: Dial connects to a ws:// URL ("ws://host:port/path"). Close it when finished; inside a request task, it is also closed automatically when its scope ends.
- `(c Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetMaxMessage(n i64)`: SetMaxMessage sets the largest message Read accepts (default 16 MiB); a bigger one closes the connection with 1009.
- `(c Conn) WriteText(s str) !`: WriteText sends s as a text message.
- `(c Conn) WriteBinary(b []u8) !`: WriteBinary sends b as a binary message.
- `(c Conn) Ping() !`: Ping sends a ping; the peer's pong is consumed by Read.
- `(c Conn) CloseWith(code i64, reason str) !`: CloseWith sends a close frame with code and reason; the connection then only drains.
- `(c Conn) Close()`: Close sends a normal close (1000) and, for a client, closes the connection.
- `IsClosed(err fault) bool`: IsClosed reports whether err is the normal end of a connection: the peer closed it.
- `(c Conn) Read() !Message`: Read returns the next message; it answers pings and joins fragments on the way. When the peer closes, it answers the close and fails with "websocket: closed (code)". The returned message lives in the caller's pool. For a long-lived stream, use Each to reset message allocations after every callback without invalidating the Conn.
- `(c Conn) Each(h func(Conn, Message) !) !`: Each reads messages and calls h until a read or callback fails. Every callback has a reusable message pool: use keep() to retain its data after the callback returns. The Conn and all objects allocated before Each remain valid. Callbacks may wait. A closed peer returns the same IsClosed fault as Read; callback faults propagate.
