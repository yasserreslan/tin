## say

Built into the compiler (formatting by static type, no reflection): `say.Line(a, b...)`, `say.Text(...)`, `say.Out(format, ...)`, `say.Fmt(format, ...) str`, `say.Str(x) str`, `say.Fault(format, ...) fault`, `say.To(fd, ...)`, `say.LineTo(fd, ...)`. See docs/LANGUAGE.md.

## fault

Package fault is fault chains and the standard sentinels, like Go's errors package: Wrap adds context and keeps the cause, Is walks the chain comparing identity, Join keeps several faults reachable. The runtime's sentinels are the variables Canceled, DeadlineExceeded, LimitExceeded, Overloaded, Draining and Panic; a package declares its own as `let ErrX = fault("msg")`. A function that makes a fault is declared ! here: its fault is the value (fail it, keep it in a variable, or test it). Layout and identities: notes/interface_faults.md.

- `Wrap(err fault, msg str) !`: Wrap is err with msg in front ("msg: cause"), err reachable as its cause; nil when err is nil.
- `Is(err fault, target fault) bool`: Is reports whether err or a fault in its chain (causes and joined faults) is target: the same sentinel, or the same fault.
- `Cause(err fault) !`: Cause is the fault err wraps; nil when it wraps none (and for nil and a Join).
- `Join(errs []fault) !`: Join is one fault holding every non-nil fault of errs, each reachable by Is, the messages on separate lines; nil when all are nil.
- `Message(err fault) str`: Message is the full message of err ("outer: inner" for a wrapped fault), "" for nil.
- `Backtrace(err fault) str`: Backtrace is the backtrace text of the panic in err's chain (a fault.Panic), "" for none.

## argo

Package argo writes JSON. argo.Put(b, v) appends v to the []u8 buffer b; the compiler generates a dedicated encoder for v's type (fields in declaration order, no reflection, no allocation). The w* writers below are what those encoders call. argo.Get(s, v) fills v from the JSON text s with a decoder generated the same way; it returns a fault for arrays and objects nested more than 512 deep, as each level takes stack, and leaves v unchanged on any fault. argo.GetStrict(s, v) also rejects unknown and duplicate members.

- `Put(b mut []u8, v i64)`: Put appends v as JSON to b. The compiler replaces every call with a typed encoder.
- `Str(b mut []u8, s str)`: Str appends s as a JSON string.
- `Raw(b mut []u8, s str)`: Raw appends already-encoded JSON text.
- `type Parser struct`

## io

Package io declares the streaming shapes: a type satisfies Reader, Writer, Closer or Seeker by having the methods, with no declaration, and compositions like ReadWriteCloser by satisfying every listed shape. The helpers (Copy, ReadAll, Pipe, MultiWriter, ...) and EOF as a sentinel fault land with the io port (roadmap #141); the byte, rune and string shapes (ByteReader, RuneReader, StringWriter, ...) and Go's ReaderFrom and WriterTo (which need dyn) are not declared yet.

- `shape Reader { Read(buf mut []u8) !i64 }`: Reader is anything with Read: it fills buf and returns how many bytes it wrote.
- `shape Writer { Write(data []u8) !i64 }`: Writer is anything with Write: it takes data and returns how many bytes it took.
- `shape Closer { Close() !i64 }`: Closer is anything with Close.
- `shape Seeker { Seek(offset i64, whence i64) !i64 }`: Seeker is anything with Seek: offset is relative to whence (0 start, 1 current, 2 end).
- `shape ReaderAt { ReadAt(buf mut []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: ReaderAt is a reader that does not move a position: it reads at off.
- `shape WriterAt { WriteAt(data []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: WriterAt is a writer that does not move a position: it writes at off.
- `shape ReadWriter`: ReadWriter reads and writes.
- `shape ReadCloser`: ReadCloser reads and closes.
- `shape WriteCloser`: WriteCloser writes and closes.
- `shape WriteSeeker`: WriteSeeker writes and seeks.
- `shape ReadSeekCloser`: ReadSeekCloser reads, seeks and closes.
- `shape ReadWriteCloser`: ReadWriteCloser reads, writes and closes.
- `shape ReadSeeker`: ReadSeeker reads and seeks.
- `shape ReadWriteSeeker`: ReadWriteSeeker reads, writes and seeks.

## anvil

Package anvil is an HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 server: one event loop per core (epoll, kqueue), share-nothing. HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c) is served on the same port, by prior knowledge or after Upgrade: h2c, and over TLS (ServeTLS) to a client whose ALPN offers h2; handlers are the same for both, each request (or stream) in a task of its own.

Core 0 accepts connections and deals them round-robin to every core through a pipe; from then on a connection belongs to one core for its whole life. Each core reads into one scratch buffer, parses requests in place, runs the handler, writes every response of the batch with one write, and wipes its request pool. Idle connections hold no buffers, only a 96-byte record.

```tin
type Msg struct {
	message str
}

fn handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	w.Type("application/json")
	argo.Put(mut w.Body, Msg{message: "hi"})
}

fn main() {
	anvil.Serve(":8080", handle) catch err {
		say.Line("server:", err)
	}
}
```

A Router picks the handler by method and path pattern, and runs middleware around it. Patterns match whole segments: "users" itself, {id} any one non-empty segment, and a last {path...} or * the rest of the path. Static segments win over {name}, and {name} over the rest, segment by segment, whatever the order of registration. A path whose routes take other methods gets 405 with Allow, any other miss 404; HEAD falls back to GET. A trailing slash is part of the path: /users/ and /users are different routes. Write patterns with {...} as raw strings: in "..." the braces would interpolate.

```tin
fn user(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	let id = q.PathParam("id")
	w.Text("user {id}")
}

fn logged(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out, next fn(anvil.Req, mut anvil.Out)) {
	next(q, mut w)
	herald.Log(herald.LInfo, "request", []str{
		"method", q.Method, "route", q.Pattern(), "status", say.Str(w.Code()), "client", q.ClientIP(),
	})
}

fn main() {
	let r = anvil.NewRouter()
	r.Use(logged)
	r.Get(`/users/{id}`, user)
	r.Route("/admin", fn(g mut anvil.Router) {
		g.Use(logged)
		g.Delete(`/users/{id}`, user)
	})
	r.Serve(":8080") catch err {
		say.Line("server:", err)
	}
}
```

The middleware writes one herald line per request, with the client's address as client:

```text
2026-10-05T09:00:00.000Z INFO core=0 request method=GET route=/users/{id} status=200 client=203.0.113.7
```

q.ClientIP() is the connection's peer unless the peer is one of the TrustedProxies: behind a proxy of yours, call TrustedProxies first, or every line carries the proxy's address.

ServeTLS (and Router.ServeTLS) serve HTTPS: TLS 1.3 with a PEM certificate chain and key, each handshake in a task of its own, then the same event loop with records decrypted before parsing and sealed before writing (docs/RUNTIME.md). examples/https_server.tin.

- `TrustedProxies(cidrs []str) !`: TrustedProxies sets the proxies whose X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded headers ClientIP believes, as networks ("10.0.0.0/8", "fd00::/8") or single addresses. Call it before Serve. With none (the default) ClientIP is the connection's peer: the headers are written by the client and prove nothing unless a proxy you run replaced them.
- `(q Req) RemoteAddr() str`: RemoteAddr is the address the request's connection comes from, "ip:port" ("[ip]:port" for IPv6, and an IPv4 client of an IPv6 listener as IPv4), or "" for a request made in the process. It is read once per connection. A request replayed from a capsule (#242) gets the address it was recorded with, "" when the capsule is older than that (schema 1).
- `(q Req) ClientIP() str`: ClientIP is the client's IP address: the connection's peer, or, when the peer is one of the TrustedProxies, the rightmost address of X-Forwarded-For (else Forwarded's for=) that is not a trusted proxy. A malformed entry ends the walk at the peer. "" for a request made in the process.
- `type Req struct`: Req is the request being served. Its strings live in the request pool: keep() them to store them anywhere long-lived.
- `type Out struct`: Out is the response being built. Body is the response body; the status defaults to 200 and the content type to text/plain.
- `Serve(addr str, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: Serve listens on addr (":8080", "127.0.0.1:8080") and serves h on every core. It returns only if the server cannot start. TIN_CORES overrides the number of cores.
- `ServeN(addr str, n i64, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `Drain(grace i64)`: Drain starts the graceful shutdown from code, as SIGTERM does (#238): listeners close, the requests in flight finish, and after grace nanoseconds what is left is cancelled with fault.Draining; then the cores stop, Serve returns and the stop events run. Any core may call it; it does nothing outside a server or once a shutdown started.
- `Timeouts(header i64, read i64, idle i64, write i64)`: Timeouts sets the connection timeouts in milliseconds; 0 turns one off. header: a request's line and headers must arrive within it (slowloris); read: the whole request, body included; idle: a keep-alive connection with no request in progress; write: a response the client stops reading (no progress for this long). A connection is closed when one passes; a request whose handler is running is governed by Deadline instead. Defaults 10000, 60000, 60000 and 30000; TIN_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_READ_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS and TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS override them. Call before Serve.
- `type Load struct`: Load is what an admission policy sees of the core a new request arrived on: its waiting request tasks, live connections, bytes buffered for requests still arriving, how many requests were refused so far, the request-pool bytes its requests hold beyond each one's first chunk (what TIN_REQUEST_MEMORY counts), and the bytes its long-lived (ingot) heap holds (design_semantics §11).
- `Admit(p fn(Load) bool)`: Admit sets the admission policy (call before Serve): after the built-in limits, p decides each new request before its handler runs; false answers 503 with Retry-After: 1 without running the handler. Every core calls p with its own Load.
- `Limits(maxBody i64, maxBuffered i64, maxConns i64)`: Limits sets the largest request body in bytes (413 past it), the bytes of requests still arriving that one core may buffer (a new partial request past it gets 503 and close), and the connections per core (more are closed at accept; 0: no limit). Defaults 64 MiB, 256 MiB and 16384; TIN_MAX_BODY, TIN_MAX_BUFFERED and TIN_MAX_CONNS override them. Call before Serve.
- `Deadline(ms i64)`: Deadline makes every request's waits (tide.Wait, client calls) fail with "deadline exceeded" once ms have passed since the request started (0: no deadline; call before Serve). TIN_DEADLINE_MS sets it too; the default is 30000.
- `(q Req) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the value of the request header name (any case), or "". A chunked request's trailer fields are read after the header block's.
- `(q Req) Proto() str`: Proto is the protocol the request came in: "HTTP/2.0" (h2c, or h2 over TLS), "HTTP/1.1" or "HTTP/1.0". A request made with Router.Run is "HTTP/1.1".
- `(q Req) Hijack() !i64`: Hijack takes the request's connection out of HTTP for a protocol of its own (the websocket package uses it): the responses before this request are written, the core stops reading the connection and the request's deadline no longer applies. It returns the non-blocking descriptor, for the caller's I/O until the handler returns; then anvil closes it. The handler's Out is not sent. An HTTP/2 stream cannot be hijacked: Hijack fails there.
- `(w mut Out) Stream() !`: Stream switches the response to streaming. The status, content type and headers set so far are sent with the first Write or Flush (set them before). The body is then written with Write and Flush, in chunks (Transfer-Encoding: chunked), or as a plain body of the size Length gave; an HTTP/1.0 client, which cannot read chunks, gets the body up to the end of the connection. Each write waits for a slow client within the write timeout (TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS), and the request deadline (TIN_DEADLINE_MS) counts from the last write, so a stream lives as long as it keeps writing. Calling Stream again does nothing. On HTTP/2 the body goes in DATA frames within the client's flow-control windows, and Length sets content-length.
- `(w mut Out) Length(n i64) !`: Length sets the size of the streamed body in bytes: the response then has a Content-Length header instead of chunks, and the handler must write exactly n bytes. Call it after Stream and before the first Write or Flush.
- `(w mut Out) Write(b []u8) !`: Write sends b as part of the body, after the head if that is not out yet. It waits while the client does not read, and fails when the client has closed the connection, stopped reading for the write timeout, or the request was cancelled: the handler should stop then. Text appended to the body with Text or argo.Put(mut w.Body, v) is sent by the next Write or Flush.
- `(w mut Out) WriteString(s str) !`: WriteString is Write for a str.
- `(w mut Out) Flush() !`: Flush sends the head if it is not out yet and what Text or argo.Put put in the body so far, as one chunk: with it a handler makes a client see an event now.
- `(w mut Out) Abort()`: Abort ends a stream the handler cannot finish (its data source failed halfway): the connection closes without the last chunk, so the client sees an incomplete response instead of a short one that looks complete. Before the head is sent, the response is an ordinary one again.
- `(w Out) Closed() bool`: Closed reports whether the client has closed the connection (a stream's handler asks between events: a write only fails once the client's reset arrives).
- `(w mut Out) SendFile(path str, off i64, n i64) !`: SendFile sends n bytes of the file at path, from byte off, as the body (n < 0: to the end of the file). As the whole body of a response that is not streaming yet it starts the stream with a Content-Length of n, so a download is `w.SendFile(path, 0, -1)`; in a stream already begun, the bytes go out as chunks or as part of the Content-Length body. The file goes to the socket with sendfile(2) in pieces of 1 MiB on a helper thread, so it is never read into the request pool and a slow disk does not stop the core; each piece waits for a slow client within the write timeout.
- `(q Req) Body() str`: Body returns the request body (a chunked one decoded).
- `(q Req) BodyBound(n i64) !str`: BodyBound returns the request body when it is at most n bytes, and otherwise fails with fault.LimitExceeded before copying any of it: the compiler calls it for q.Body() into a bounded type (try bound(q.Body()), #240).
- `(q Req) Param(name str) str`: Param returns query parameter name, %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) PathParam(name str) str`: PathParam returns path parameter name of the Router route that matched ({name}, {name...}, or "*" for a last *), %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) Pattern() str`: Pattern returns the pattern of the Router route serving the request ("/users/{id}"), or "" (no Router, or a 404 or 405 answer).
- `(w mut Out) Status(code i64)`: Status sets the response status code.
- `(w mut Out) Type(t str)`: Type sets the Content-Type header. CR, LF and NUL in t become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines.
- `(w mut Out) Head(k str, v str)`: Head adds a response header. A name that is not an HTTP token is ignored, and so are Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding and Connection: anvil writes the framing itself. CR, LF and NUL in the value become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines or a body (response splitting), as Go's net/http does.
- `(w mut Out) Trailer(k str, v str)`: Trailer adds a trailer field, sent after the body: on HTTP/2 in a HEADERS frame that ends the stream (gRPC's grpc-status and grpc-message), on HTTP/1.1 after the last chunk of a chunked stream (w.Stream() without Length). A response with a Content-Length cannot carry trailers in HTTP/1.1: they are dropped there. Like Head, a name that is not a token and the framing fields are ignored, and CR, LF and NUL in the value become spaces.
- `(w mut Out) Text(s str)`: Text appends s to the body.
- `(w mut Out) Json()`: Json sets the JSON content type; the body is then written with argo.Put(mut w.Body, v).
- `(w Out) Code() i64`: Code returns the response status set so far (200 unless Status changed it).
- `(w Out) Header(k str) str`: Header returns response header k as set so far (Type sets Content-Type, Head the rest), or "".
- `(w mut Out) SetValue(key str, value str)`: SetValue stores value under key for the rest of the request: middleware hand data (a user id, a request id) to the handlers after them this way. Value reads it back.
- `(w Out) Value(key str) str`: Value returns what SetValue stored under key in this request, or "".
- `OnRelay(h fn(i64, str))`: OnRelay makes every core run h(from, msg) for each relay message it receives (call before Serve). Handlers run between requests, with their own request pool.
- `OnTick(ms i64, h fn(i64))`: OnTick makes every core run h(core) every ms milliseconds (call before Serve).
- `type Router struct`: Router sends each request to the handler routed for its method and path pattern, through the middleware added with Use. Build it in main (or in a function a global's initializer calls), then Serve it, or try requests on it with Run.
- `NewRouter() Router`: NewRouter makes an empty router: every request gets 404 until routes are added.
- `(r mut Router) Get(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Get routes GET requests for pattern to h, and HEAD requests unless Head routes them.
- `(r mut Router) Post(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Post routes POST requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Put(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Put routes PUT requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Patch(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Patch routes PATCH requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Delete(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Delete routes DELETE requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Head(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Head routes HEAD requests for pattern to h (without it, they go to the GET route).
- `(r mut Router) Options(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Options routes OPTIONS requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Handle(method str, pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Handle routes requests with method (any HTTP method name, like "PROPFIND") for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Any(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Any routes requests for pattern with every method to h; a route for the request's own method on the same pattern wins over it.
- `(r mut Router) Use(mw fn(Req, mut Out, fn(Req, mut Out)))`: Use adds middleware mw to r. Middleware run in the order added, around every route of r and of the routers mounted in it, and around their 404 and 405 answers. Each gets next, the rest of the chain, and decides whether and when to call it.
- `(r mut Router) Route(prefix str, build fn(mut Router))`: Route groups routes under prefix ("/api"): build adds them to a new router mounted there.
- `(r mut Router) Mount(prefix str, sub Router)`: Mount serves sub's routes under prefix: "/api" and "/users" make "/api/users", and "/api" and "" make "/api". r's middleware run before sub's, and sub's 404 and 405 answers (with its middleware) cover the paths under prefix.
- `(r mut Router) NotFound(h fn(Req, mut Out))`: NotFound sets the handler for the paths no route matches (under r's prefix when r is mounted); the status starts as 404.
- `(r mut Router) MethodNotAllowed(h fn(Req, mut Out))`: MethodNotAllowed sets the handler for the paths whose routes take other methods; the status starts as 405 and the Allow header lists those methods.
- `(r Router) Check() !`: Check fails with r's first bad pattern, conflicting route or misplaced mount, the error Serve would fail with before listening.
- `(r Router) Serve(addr str) !`: Serve listens on addr and serves r on every core, like anvil.Serve. The routes are checked and compiled once, into a table every core reads; Serve fails with r's error, if any (see Check).
- `(r Router) ServeN(addr str, n i64) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `(r Router) Run(method str, target str, body str) Out`: Run sends one request through r on this thread, as Serve would (middleware, 404, 405), and returns the response: for tests. target is the path and query ("/users/7?full=1"), the request has no headers, and a HEAD response keeps its body. Run panics if r has an error (see Check).
- `(r Router) Match(method str, path str) str`: Match returns the pattern of the route that would serve method and path ("/users/{id}"), or "" when the request would get 404 or 405. Like Run, it panics if r has an error (see Check).
- `StuckCores() i64`: StuckCores is how many cores have not turned their event loop for 1.5 seconds: each is running something that does not wait (a handler stuck in a loop, say). 0 while no server runs.
- `StuckFor() i64`: StuckFor is how long, in milliseconds, the most stuck core's event loop has not turned (0: every core turns). A service can export it and alert before a stuck core is an outage.
- `ServeTLS(addr str, certPEM str, keyPEM str, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeTLS is Serve over TLS 1.3 (HTTPS): certPEM is the certificate chain (leaf first) and keyPEM the leaf's private key (RSA, or ECDSA P-256 or P-384), as PEM text. The pair is checked before listening. ALPN offers "h2" (HTTP/2) and then "http/1.1"; a client without ALPN gets HTTP/1.1. Each handshake runs in a task, so slow clients never hold a core; it must finish within TIN_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS (default: the header timeout, 10 s). Clients without TLS 1.3 are refused with a protocol_version alert, and those whose ALPN offers neither protocol with no_application_protocol.
- `(r Router) ServeTLS(addr str, certPEM str, keyPEM str) !`: ServeTLS is Serve over TLS 1.3, as anvil.ServeTLS: the routes are checked first, then the certificate and key.
- `type TLSConfig struct`: TLSConfig configures ServeTLSConfig: the certificate chain and private key, as ServeTLS takes them, more certificates chosen by the client's server name (#476), and client certificates (mutual TLS, #475).
- `type TLSCert struct`: TLSCert is one certificate chain (leaf first) and its private key: PEM text, or the paths of PEM files, which the server reads again when they change (#476).
- `ReloadCertificates(certs []TLSCert) !`: ReloadCertificates replaces the server's certificates, from any core while it serves: the first is the default, the others are chosen by the client's server name. Every pair is checked first, and a bad one fails the call and changes nothing. Each core switches at its next handshake; connections already up keep their own. Pairs given as files are read now, and when the whole set was given as files, core 0 reads them again every TIN_TLS_RELOAD_S seconds (default 60) and reloads when they changed, so a renewal written to disk needs no call.
- `ServeTLSConfig(addr str, cfg TLSConfig, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeTLSConfig is ServeTLS with a TLSConfig. With ClientAuth set, every full handshake asks for a client certificate: RequireClientCert refuses a client without one (certificate_required), and both refuse one that does not chain to ClientCAs for client authentication. A handler finds the verified chain in q.TLSConn().PeerCertificates().
- `(r Router) ServeTLSConfig(addr str, cfg TLSConfig) !`: ServeTLSConfig is Serve over TLS with a TLSConfig, as anvil.ServeTLSConfig.
- `(q Req) TLSConn() ?tls.Conn`: TLSConn is the TLS connection the request arrived on, or nil over plain TCP: for its ALPN(), CipherSuite() and Group(). After Hijack every byte must go through it (Read, Write, Close), since the descriptor carries records.

## hearth

Package hearth runs a program on every core: one thread per core, each with its own globals, request pool and ingot heap. Cores share nothing; relay carries messages.

- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of CPUs this program may use: the CPUs online, capped on Linux by the affinity mask (cpuset) and the cgroup CPU quota (ceil of cpu.max quota/period); never 0.
- `MemLimit() i64`: MemLimit is the memory limit in bytes the container (cgroup) imposes: 0 when there is none.
- `ID() i64`: ID is the current core's number: 0 for the main core.
- `Run(n i64, entry fn(i64))`: Run starts entry(i) on cores 1..n-1, runs entry(0) here, then waits for every core. Before starting it sizes the request pools to the memory limit and decides whether cores pin themselves to CPUs (only when they map one-to-one onto the allowed CPUs, or TIN_PIN=1).
- `PoolChunk() i64`: PoolChunk is the request pool chunk size in bytes each core uses (after pool_tune).
- `PoolCapacity() i64`: PoolCapacity is the usable size in bytes of this core's current base pool chunk (0 before its first request allocation).
- `Reset()`: Reset ends the current request: the core's pool is emptied for the next one.
- `HeapStats() (i64, i64, i64)`: HeapStats reports what this core's long-lived heap has from the system (#345): the bytes of its slabs (blocks up to 256 KiB), the bytes of the mappings of its larger blocks (those in use and those kept for reuse) and the number of mappings in all.
- `Quiet(wait fn())`: Quiet runs wait (a tide.Wait, a receive from a channel) with the calling task taken out of the runtime's reclamation epochs (#358). A task that lives for hours, such as a detach loop, holds back the release of every long-lived value dropped on its core while it lives, and past a million waiting blocks the core stops releasing them (RcStats shows the limbo). A task that waits inside Quiet holds back nothing, on the condition that it holds no value it borrowed from long-lived memory across the call: `let u = cache[k]` before Quiet is not safe to use after it, so read it again. websocket.Conn's reads work this way.
- `RcStats() (i64, i64, i64)`: RcStats reports what long-lived memory this core still counts (#176): the number of counted blocks, their bytes and how many dropped blocks wait in the limbo.

## relay

Package relay carries messages between cores, which share no memory. A message is a str copied into the receiving core's inbox (a lock-free multi-producer queue); the receiver gets its own copy in its request pool. Encode structs with argo.Put/argo.Get.

```tin body
relay.Send(2, "hello")              // from any core
let (from, msg) = relay.Recv()      // on core 2: blocks until a message arrives
let (from, msg) = try relay.Next()  // the same, but fails on a deadline or cancel
```

- `Send(to i64, msg str)`: Send copies msg into core to's inbox; it never blocks.
- `Broadcast(msg str)`: Broadcast sends msg to every other running core.
- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of cores the program started.
- `TryRecv() (i64, str, bool)`: TryRecv returns the next message for this core, if there is one.
- `Recv() (i64, str)`: Recv blocks until a message for this core arrives and returns its sender and text. It blocks the whole core and ignores deadlines and cancels; use Next in tasks and within blocks.
- `Next() !(i64, str)`: Next waits until a message for this core arrives and returns its sender and text. Unlike Recv it waits through rt_task_wait: inside a task the core serves other tasks meanwhile, and a deadline (within, the request's) or a cancel ends the wait with that fault. Under anvil.OnRelay the event loop takes every message, so do not call Next there.
- `WakeFD() i64`: WakeFD is this core's wake-up descriptor, for event loops: after it turns readable, call Drain. Arm must be called before the loop blocks.
- `Arm()`: Arm asks senders to wake this core through WakeFD (call just before blocking).
- `Drain(h fn(i64, str))`: Drain runs h on every waiting message (event loops call it after WakeFD fires).
- `Received() i64`: Received is how many messages this core has taken from its inbox.
- `Me() i64`: Me is this core's number.

## task

Package task reads the deadline and cancellation of the running code, which belong to its innermost boundary (the request, a `within` or `limit` block, a scope's child; Go's context.Context Deadline and Err, without passing a context). Waits already fail when either stops the code: these are for code that does not wait, or that wants to stop at a point of its own choosing.

- `Deadline() i64`: Deadline is the effective deadline of the running code in tide.Now() nanoseconds (the earliest of its request's and every enclosing within block's), or 0 when it has none.
- `Canceled() !`: Canceled is nil while the running code may go on, else the fault its next wait would fail with: fault.DeadlineExceeded once the deadline has passed, fault.LimitExceeded past a budget, or fault.Canceled wrapping the reason of a cancel or drain.

## wire

Package wire is TCP networking and a small HTTP/1.1 client. Calls block the calling core (servers should use anvil); every connection can carry a read/write timeout.

```tin body
let c = try wire.Dial("127.0.0.1:6379")
try c.Write("PING\r\n")
let r = try wire.Get("http://127.0.0.1:8080/json")
```

- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a TCP connection.
- `type Listener struct`: Listener accepts TCP connections.
- `type Resp struct`: Resp is an HTTP response.
- `IsEOF(err fault) bool`: EOF is the fault Read returns at the end of the stream.
- `Dial(addr str) !Conn`: Dial connects to "host:port".
- `DialTimeout(addr str, timeout i64) !Conn`: DialTimeout connects to "host:port", giving up after timeout nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) Fd() i64`: Fd is the connection's descriptor, for clients that do their own I/O on it (it stays non-blocking; Close still closes it).
- `(c mut Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetNoDelay(on bool)`: SetNoDelay turns Nagle's algorithm off (true) or on.
- `(c Conn) Write(s str) !`: Write sends all of s.
- `(c Conn) WriteBytes(b []u8) !`: WriteBytes sends all of b.
- `(c Conn) Read(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: Read appends up to max bytes to buf and returns how many; at the end it returns 0 and EOF.
- `(c Conn) ReadFull(n i64) !str`: ReadFull reads exactly n bytes.
- `(c mut Conn) Close()`: Close closes the connection.
- `Listen(addr str) !Listener`: Listen opens a TCP listener on "host:port" (":0" picks a free port: see Port).
- `(l Listener) Port() i64`: Port is the port the listener is bound to.
- `(l Listener) Accept() !Conn`: Accept waits for the next connection.
- `(l Listener) AcceptTimeout(timeout i64) !Conn`: AcceptTimeout waits at most timeout ns for the next connection (0: no limit), failing with a fault that says "timed out" when none came.
- `(l mut Listener) Close()`: Close stops listening.
- `type Options struct`: Options configure one client call (DoWith); the zero value is what Do uses.
- `const DefaultMaxIdle = 8`: DefaultMaxIdle is how many idle connections per host (and core) DoWith keeps when Options.MaxIdle is 0.
- `const DefaultMaxBody = 67108864`: DefaultMaxBody is the largest response body Do accepts (64 MiB, anvil's request limit): a larger one is a fault rather than memory a broken or hostile server can fill.
- `Get(url str) !Resp`: Get fetches url.
- `Post(url str, ctype str, body str) !Resp`: Post sends body with content type ctype to url.
- `Do(method str, url str, headers []str, body str) !Resp`: Do sends one request: headers is a list of name, value pairs. The method and header names must be tokens, and the URL and header values must not hold CR, LF, NUL or other control bytes (the URL no spaces either), or Do fails instead of sending a request an input could have split. Response bodies over DefaultMaxBody fail; DoWith sets a timeout and the limit.  Connections are kept alive: after a response that ends cleanly (HTTP/1.1, framed by a length or chunks, no "Connection: close") the connection waits in a per-core pool, by scheme, host and port (and TLS settings), and the next call to that host uses it instead of dialing and, for https, doing a TLS handshake. A kept connection is checked before it is used, dropped after 30 s idle, and at most Options.MaxIdle are kept per host. One the server closed meanwhile is replaced by a new connection without the caller seeing it, for a GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS or TRACE; any other method (a POST) fails instead of being sent twice.
- `DoWith(method str, url str, headers []str, body str, opt Options) !Resp`: DoWith is Do with options: an overall timeout and a response size limit.
- `(r Resp) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the response header name (any case), or "".

## tls

Package tls is TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446). Clients: tls.Dial connects and handshakes, and Conn reads and writes like wire.Conn; the server's certificate is verified by default against the system's roots (plus Config.RootCAs). A server's NewSessionTicket is kept (per core, for the same name and settings) and offered on the next connection to it, which then resumes without the certificate messages (Conn.Resumed). Servers: anvil.ServeTLS serves HTTPS with this package; LoadServerConfig reads a certificate chain and its key (RSA, ECDSA P-256 or P-384), and Server runs the server side over an accepted wire.Conn. Cipher suites: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256; key exchange X25519, or P-256 by HelloRetryRequest. No 0-RTT, no renegotiation and no TLS 1.2. Every wait lets the core serve other tasks and honours Config.Timeout during the handshake, SetTimeout afterwards and a request's deadline.

```tin body
let c = try tls.Dial("example.com:443", tls.Config{ALPN: []str{"http/1.1"}})
try c.Write("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
```

- `const NoClientCert = 0`: NoClientCert, RequestClientCert and RequireClientCert are ServerConfig.ClientAuth: ask for no client certificate; ask for one and verify it when the client sends one; require a verified one.
- `const RequestClientCert = 1`
- `const RequireClientCert = 2`
- `CheckServerConfig(cfg ServerConfig) !`: CheckServerConfig checks the client-certificate settings of cfg before a server starts: a known ClientAuth, and ClientCAs that hold certificates when it asks for any.
- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a TLS 1.3 connection over a wire.Conn. After the handshake its memory only changes in place (record buffers made once, keys rewritten by seal.AEAD.Rekey), so a Conn stays valid wherever it lives: a request's pool, or keep()'s long-lived heap for a client that holds connections across requests.
- `const TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = 0x1301`: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 is cipher suite 0x1301 (Conn.CipherSuite).
- `const TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = 0x1302`: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 is cipher suite 0x1302.
- `const TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 = 0x1303`: TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 is cipher suite 0x1303.
- `type ServerConfig struct`: ServerConfig configures a TLS server: its certificate chain and private key, and the application protocols it speaks.
- `LoadServerConfig(certPEM str, keyPEM str) !ServerConfig`: LoadServerConfig reads a PEM certificate chain (leaf first) and the leaf's PEM private key and checks that they belong together.
- `Server(conn wire.Conn, cfg ServerConfig) !Conn`: Server runs the server side of the handshake over an accepted connection. The Conn owns conn from then on: its Close closes conn. Every wait lets the core serve other tasks.
- `ServerOnFd(fd i64, cfg ServerConfig) !Conn`: ServerOnFd runs the server handshake on a socket another package owns (anvil): the Conn never closes fd. Used with ReadRaw and SealRaw.
- `(c mut Conn) ReadRaw(p i64, cap i64) (i64, []u8)`: ReadRaw reads what the socket has without waiting, decrypts whole records and copies up to cap bytes of application data to the raw buffer at p. It returns the bytes copied (more than 0; -1 when nothing is available yet; 0 once the peer closed with close_notify or end of input; -2 when the connection is broken) and ciphertext the caller must send next: a KeyUpdate answer, or for -2 the alert to send before closing. It never waits.
- `(c mut Conn) ClosedRaw() (bool, []u8)`: ClosedRaw reports, without waiting, whether the peer has ended the connection: its close_notify or another alert arrived, the socket reached end of input, or it failed. It decrypts what the socket has, record by record, and stops at the first one of application data, which stays buffered for ReadRaw; a KeyUpdate answer (or the alert to send) is returned for the caller to send. For a stream that asks whether its client went away: a peek at the socket sees only ciphertext.
- `SealRawSize(n i64) i64`: SealRawSize is the most bytes SealRawTo writes for n bytes of application data.
- `(c mut Conn) SealRaw(p i64, n i64) ![]u8`: SealRaw encrypts n bytes of application data at the raw address p into records (16 KiB each, a KeyUpdate first when the write key is worn out) for the caller to send.
- `(c mut Conn) SealRawTo(p i64, n i64, dst i64) !i64`: SealRawTo is SealRaw into raw memory at dst, which holds SealRawSize(n) bytes; it returns the bytes written. Each record is built and sealed in place there, so nothing it allocates grows with n: an event loop seals into a buffer it reuses.
- `(c mut Conn) CloseNotifyRaw() []u8`: CloseNotifyRaw is the close_notify alert record to send before closing.
- `(c Conn) PendingRaw() bool`: PendingRaw reports whether the Conn holds input ReadRaw has not returned yet: decrypted data, or bytes of a record read from the socket. An event loop that stopped reading (its output was blocked) calls ReadRaw again when this is true, since the socket will not report that input.
- `(c mut Conn) ReleaseRaw()`: ReleaseRaw ends a Conn kept in long-lived memory before its owner drops it: it marks it closed and resets the failure text, which a failed Read or Write made in a request's pool, so releasing the Conn never follows a pointer into a pool that is gone. Nothing is sent.
- `SetTicketSecret(key secret []u8) !`: SetTicketSecret sets the 32-byte secret the server's session-ticket keys are derived from. Servers that share it (several processes behind one load balancer) resume each other's sessions. Call it before the server starts; the default is a random secret per process, or the 64 hex digits of TIN_TLS_TICKET_SECRET.
- `type Credential struct`: Credential is a certificate chain (DER, leaf first), its private key, and the names its leaf covers (its DNS names and IP addresses, lower case), for ServerConfig.Others.
- `LoadCredential(certPEM str, keyPEM str) !Credential`: LoadCredential reads a PEM certificate chain (leaf first) and the leaf's PEM private key and checks that they belong together.
- `type Config struct`: Config configures a client connection; the zero value verifies the server against the system's roots for the name in the address.
- `Dial(addr str, cfg Config) !Conn`: Dial connects to "host:port" and runs the handshake. ServerName defaults to host.
- `Client(conn wire.Conn, cfg Config) !Conn`: Client runs the handshake over an established connection, for protocols that switch to TLS mid-stream (MySQL, PostgreSQL). cfg.ServerName is required unless InsecureSkipVerify is set. The Conn owns conn from then on: its Close closes conn.
- `(c mut Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c mut Conn) SetDeadline(at i64)`: SetDeadline makes every later wait fail once the monotonic clock (tide.Now) passes at (0: no deadline), whatever the per-call timeout: wire uses it for a whole HTTP call.
- `(c Conn) ALPN() str`: ALPN is the application protocol the server chose ("" when none).
- `(c Conn) CipherSuite() i64`: CipherSuite is the negotiated cipher suite (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and so on).
- `(c Conn) Group() str`: Group is the key exchange: "X25519", or "P-256" when the server asked for it.
- `const VersionTLS13 = 0x0304`: VersionTLS13 is TLS 1.3's protocol version (Conn.Version).
- `(c Conn) Version() i64`: Version is the negotiated protocol version: VersionTLS13.
- `(c Conn) Resumed() bool`: Resumed reports whether the handshake resumed an earlier session with a ticket: the server's certificate was checked on that session, and PeerCertificates is empty.
- `(c Conn) PeerCertificates() [][]u8`: PeerCertificates is the peer's certificate chain as sent (DER, leaf first): on a client the server's, on a server the client's when it sent one (mutual TLS, #475).
- `(c Conn) Fd() i64`: Fd is the connection's descriptor (for waiting on it; never read or write it directly).
- `(c Conn) Buffered() i64`: Buffered is how many decrypted bytes a Read returns without waiting.
- `(c mut Conn) Read(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: Read appends up to max bytes of application data to buf and returns how many; after the server's close_notify it fails with EOF (wire.IsEOF), and a connection the server drops without close_notify is a fault, not EOF (a truncation would otherwise look complete).
- `(c mut Conn) ReadNow(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: ReadNow is Read without waiting: it returns 0 when no application data can be had without waiting for the socket (then wait until Fd is readable and call it again). For clients that run their own non-blocking loop; data TLS has already buffered is always returned first.
- `(c mut Conn) ReadNowTo(p i64, max i64) !i64`: ReadNowTo is ReadNow into the raw buffer at p, at most max bytes: for trusted code that keeps its own buffers (the kafka client reads frames of many megabytes this way, with no copy per record).
- `(c mut Conn) ReadFull(n i64) !str`: ReadFull reads exactly n bytes.
- `(c mut Conn) WriteBytes(b []u8) !`: WriteBytes sends all of b.
- `(c mut Conn) Write(s str) !`: Write sends all of s.
- `(c mut Conn) Close()`: Close sends close_notify and closes the connection; closing twice does nothing.

- `Cut(s str, sep str) (str, str, bool)`: Cut splits s around the first sep, returning (before, after, true), or (s, "", false) when absent.
- `type Builder struct`: Builder accumulates bytes; the zero Builder{} is ready to use, NewBuilder preallocates.
- `NewBuilder(n i64) Builder`: NewBuilder returns an empty Builder with room for n bytes.
- `(b mut Builder) Str(s str)`: Str appends s.
- `(b mut Builder) Byte(c u8)`: Byte appends one byte.

## bits

Package bits counts, rotates and reverses the bits of fixed-width unsigned integers, and does 64-bit and 32-bit arithmetic with carries (like Go's math/bits). Every name carries its width; PopCount is Go's OnesCount; there is no uint-wide form because Tin has no uint.

## link

Package link parses, builds and resolves URLs, and escapes and unescapes their parts (like Go's net/url). A URL is a struct; its User is an optional (nil when the URL has no userinfo); query parameters are a Values, a small wrapper over map[str][]str whose keys keep insertion order and whose Encode sorts them. Faults carry Go's messages: parse "x": invalid URL escape "%zz".

- `QueryUnescape(s str) !str`: QueryUnescape converts each %AB in s to the byte 0xAB and each + to a space; a % not followed by two hex digits is a fault.
- `PathUnescape(s str) !str`: PathUnescape is QueryUnescape for a path segment: + stays a plus sign.
- `QueryEscape(s str) str`: QueryEscape escapes s for use as a query key or value: a space becomes +.
- `PathEscape(s str) str`: PathEscape escapes s for use as one path segment: / and ? are escaped too.

A URL whose rest after the scheme does not start with a slash is opaque: scheme:opaque[?query][#fragment]. Path and Fragment are stored decoded; RawPath and RawFragment hold the original encoding when it differs from the default one (EscapedPath and EscapedFragment use them).
- `(u URL) Clone() URL`: Clone returns a copy of u (a plain assignment of a struct shares it).
- `Parse(rawURL str) !URL`: Parse parses a URL, absolute or relative; a hostname and path without a scheme is invalid but may not be rejected, because of parsing ambiguities.
- `ParseRequestURI(rawURL str) !URL`: ParseRequestURI parses a URL received in an HTTP request: an absolute URI or an absolute path, without a #fragment.
- `(u URL) EscapedPath() str`: EscapedPath returns u.RawPath when it is a valid encoding of u.Path, else the default escaping.

- `(u URL) Port() str`: Port returns the port of u.Host, or "" when there is none.
- `(u URL) RequestURI() str`: RequestURI returns what goes in an HTTP request line: the escaped path (or / when empty) and query, or the opaque part.
- `(u URL) Query() Values`: Query parses u.RawQuery, keeping every well-formed parameter and skipping malformed ones.
- `(u URL) Parse(ref str) !URL`: Parse parses ref (which may be relative) in the context of u: Parse then ResolveReference.
- `(u URL) ResolveReference(ref URL) URL`: ResolveReference resolves a URI reference against u as an absolute URI (RFC 3986 section 5.2): ref may be relative or absolute, and u is typically an absolute URL.
- `(u URL) JoinPath(elems []str) URL`: JoinPath returns a copy of u with the elements joined onto its path (cleaned, with a trailing slash kept if the last element had one).
- `JoinPath(base str, elems []str) !str`: JoinPath parses base and joins the elements onto its path, returning the URL as a string.

- `(v Values) Has(key str) bool`: Has reports whether key is present.
- `(v Values) Keys() []str`: Keys returns the keys in the order they were first added.
- `(v Values) Len() i64`: Len returns the number of keys.
- `ParseQuery(query str) !Values`: ParseQuery parses a URL query ("a=1&b=2&a=3") into Values. It faults on the first malformed parameter (a bad escape, or a semicolon separator); URL.Query keeps the good ones instead.
- `(v Values) Encode() str`: Encode returns the values URL-encoded ("a=1&a=3&b=2"), sorted by key.

## ore

## flume

Package flume reads and writes file descriptors through 64 KiB buffers: lines, whole files and buffered output with one write per flush.

- `type Reader struct`: Reader buffers reads from a file descriptor. Inside a task it waits on a pipe, socket or terminal through rt_task_wait, so a deadline or cancel fails the read (the next read retries).

- `Done()`: Done prints "ok N checks" or every failure, and exits with status 1 if any failed.
- `Bench(label str, n i64, f fn(i64))`: Bench runs f(i) for i in [0, n) and prints the time per call.
- `type T struct`: T is one running test: checks record failures in it, and the test continues.
- `type B struct`: B is one running benchmark: run the measured code b.N times.
- `(t mut T) Error(msg str)`: Error marks the test failed with msg (it keeps running).
- `(t mut T) Log(msg str)`: Log records msg; it is printed only if the test fails.
- `(t T) Failed() bool`: Failed reports whether the test has failed so far.
- `(t mut T) True(label str, cond bool)`: True fails the test with label unless cond holds.
- `(t mut T) False(label str, cond bool)`: False fails the test with label if cond holds.
- `(t mut T) NoFault(label str, err fault)`: NoFault fails the test if err is not nil.
- `(t mut T) HasFault(label str, err fault)`: HasFault fails the test if err is nil.
- `Equal[V constraints.Comparable](t mut T, label str, got V, want V)`: Equal fails the test unless got == want; both are printed on failure.
- `Run(name str, f fn(mut T))`: Run runs one test and prints its result like go test -v.
- `RunBench(name str, f fn(mut B))`: RunBench runs one benchmark with b.N doubling until it takes at least 1 s, then prints the time per operation.
- `Finish()`: Finish prints PASS or FAIL and exits with status 1 when a test failed.

## constraints

Package constraints contains the named generic constraints used by the standard library.

- `shape Any {}`: Any imposes no operations on a type parameter.
- `shape Comparable {}`: Comparable admits values that can be compared by value, including structs and enums whose fields are all comparable. The compiler checks this property at each instantiation.

## policy

Package policy is the with policies (design_semantics §7.1, notes/interface_policy.md): with p { body } calls p.Run(body) inside a boundary of its own, with the block as body. Slots are typed ambient values that Bind binds for a block and the tasks it spawns; Retry, Trace and Cached are the library policies.

- `shape Policy[T constraints.Any] { Run(body fn() !T) !T }`: Policy is what with p { body } needs of p: Run runs body (any number of times) and gives the block's value. Run may only call body, or pass it to a function that only calls it.
- `type Slot[T constraints.Any] struct`: Slot is a typed ambient value: with policy.Bind(s, v) { } binds it for the block and the tasks the block spawns.
- `NewSlot[T constraints.Any](name str) Slot[T]`: NewSlot makes a slot named name; declare it once, in a package-level let (one per core).
- `(s Slot[T]) Name() str`: Name is the slot's name.
- `(s Slot[T]) Get() !T`: Get is the value of the innermost Bind of s around the running code; it fails when s is not bound.
- `(s Slot[T]) Bound() bool`: Bound reports whether s is bound around the running code.
- `type BindPolicy[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any] struct`: BindPolicy binds a slot for its block (Bind).
- `Bind[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any](s Slot[V], v V) BindPolicy[V, T]`: Bind is a policy that binds s to v for its block and the tasks the block spawns: with policy.Bind(requestID, id) { }.
- `(b BindPolicy[V, T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run binds the slot on the with block's boundary, then runs body once.
- `type RetryPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: RetryPolicy runs its block again while it fails (Retry).
- `Retry[T constraints.Any](attempts i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Retry is a policy that runs its block up to attempts times while it fails and gives the last fault. A cancellation ends it at once: a cancellation fault from the block is given as it is, and a boundary cancelled (or past its deadline) between attempts gives the cancellation's fault. The block's side effects run again on each attempt.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Backoff(d i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Backoff is r waiting d before the second attempt, and twice as long before each later one.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run runs body until it succeeds, attempts runs have failed, or the boundary is cancelled.
- `SetTracer(f fn(str, i64, fault))`: SetTracer sends this core's trace spans to f(name, duration in ns, fault or nil) instead of the log.
- `type TracePolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: TracePolicy reports each run of its block (Trace).
- `Trace[T constraints.Any](name str) TracePolicy[T]`: Trace is a policy that reports its block's name, duration and fault to the core's tracer (a herald line by default).
- `(t TracePolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run runs body once and reports it.
- `type Cache[T constraints.Any] struct`: Cache is a per-core store for Cached: declare it in a package-level let. Values are kept (copied to the long-lived heap).
- `NewCache[T constraints.Any](max i64) Cache[T]`: NewCache makes a cache of at most max entries (at least one); a full cache drops its oldest entry.
- `(c Cache[T]) Len() i64`: Len is the number of entries, fresh or expired.
- `(c mut Cache[T]) Drop(key str)`: Drop removes key's entry.
- `type CachedPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: CachedPolicy answers its block from a cache (Cached).
- `Cached[T constraints.Any](c Cache[T], key str, ttl i64) CachedPolicy[T]`: Cached is a policy that gives the value cached under key while it is younger than ttl (ns), without running its block; otherwise it runs the block and caches a value it gives. Faults are not cached.
- `(p mut CachedPolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run gives the cached value, or runs body and caches its value.

## redis

Package redis is a Redis client. Commands are queries: in c.Do("SET user:{id} {body}") the values travel as separate arguments, so a value can never change a command.

Each core keeps one connection per Client. The requests a core serves at the same time share it: their commands are written together and the replies matched in order (pipelining), so a busy server makes few system calls per command. Inside a request task a call waits without blocking the core; outside one it blocks.

```tin body
let cache = redis.Open(redis.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:6379"})
try cache.Set("greeting", "hello")
let (v, found) = try cache.Get("greeting")
```

Blocking commands (BLPOP, SUBSCRIBE, ...) would hold up the commands queued behind them and are not supported.

- `type Reply enum`: Reply is one Redis reply.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `ParseURL(url str) !Options`: ParseURL reads "redis://[[user]:password@]host[:port][/db]"; "rediss://" is the same over TLS 1.3 (TLS is set, so the server's certificate is verified for host).
- `type Client struct`: Client sends commands to one Redis server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(c Client) Do(q query) !Reply`: Do sends one command and returns its reply; an error reply fails.
- `(c Client) Pipe(qs []query) ![]Reply`: Pipe sends commands together and returns their replies in order; error replies come back as Err. The commands go out back to back, so MULTI ... EXEC in one Pipe is atomic.
- `(c Client) Get(key str) !(str, bool)`: Get returns the value at key, and whether there is one.
- `(c Client) Set(key str, value str) !`: Set stores value at key.
- `(c Client) SetEx(key str, value str, ttl i64) !`: SetEx stores value at key for ttl nanoseconds (at least a millisecond).
- `(c Client) Del(key str) !i64`: Del removes key; it returns how many keys it removed (0 or 1).
- `(c Client) Incr(key str) !i64`: Incr adds one to the integer at key and returns the result.
- `(c Client) Expire(key str, ttl i64) !bool`: Expire makes key expire after ttl nanoseconds; false when there is no such key.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.

## mysql

Package mysql is a MySQL client (tested with MySQL 8.0). Statements are queries: in db.Query("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = {id}") the text becomes "... id = ?" and id a bound parameter of a prepared statement, so a value can never change a statement.

Each core keeps a pool of connections per Client (Options.Pool, default max(2, 64/cores); Options.MaxTotal caps them for the process); a request task waits for a free one without blocking the core. Prepared statements are cached per connection. Authentication: caching_sha2_password (the MySQL 8 default, including the RSA key exchange when the server has no cached entry) and mysql_native_password. Options.TLS connects over TLS 1.3 (SSLRequest), verifying the server's certificate and name.

Sizing: a Client opened in a global's initializer is opened on every core, so a 32-core pod with Pool 16 may open 512 connections to one server, and a fleet of pods multiplies that. Pool, when not set, is max(2, 64/cores) per core: about 64 for the process, at least 2 on each core. Options.MaxTotal caps the connections of the whole process, over all cores (Clients with the same address, user, database and MaxTotal share one cap): a core at the cap waits, within the request's deadline and Options.Timeout, until a connection is released or a core that has one idle gives up its slot. Set MaxTotal to at least the number of cores that serve database requests; below that, cores share connections by closing and dialing again.

```tin body
let pw = quarry.Getenv("MYSQL_PASSWORD")
let id = 7
let db = mysql.Open(mysql.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:3306", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
let rows = try db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = {id}")
for r in rows.Rows {
	say.Line(r[0].Int(), r[1].Text())
}
```

- `type Value enum`: Value is one column of a row.
- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one MySQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(v Value) IsNull() bool`: IsNull reports whether v is NULL.
- `(v Value) Int() i64`: Int is v as an integer (a Text or Float converted, NULL and bad text 0).
- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement and returns its rows.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement and returns what it changed.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin starts a transaction; finish it with Commit or Rollback, or its connection stays out of the pool.
- `(t mut Tx) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement in the transaction and returns its rows.
- `(t mut Tx) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement in the transaction.
- `(t mut Tx) Commit() !`: Commit makes the transaction's changes permanent.
- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes.

## postgres

Package postgres is a PostgreSQL protocol 3.0 client over TCP. Query interpolation binds binary parameters as $1, $2, ...; a plain str cannot be used as SQL. Connections are pooled per core (Options.Pool, default max(2, 64/cores); Options.MaxTotal caps them for the process) and waiting request tasks park without blocking it. Authentication supports SCRAM-SHA-256, MD5 and cleartext. Options.SSLMode turns on TLS 1.3 (SSLRequest): "require" encrypts, "verify-full" (the default when Options.TLS is set) also checks the server's certificate and name.

Sizing: a Client opened in a global's initializer is opened on every core, so a 32-core pod with Pool 16 may open 512 connections to one server, and a fleet of pods multiplies that. Pool, when not set, is max(2, 64/cores) per core: about 64 for the process, at least 2 on each core. Options.MaxTotal caps the connections of the whole process, over all cores (Clients with the same address, user, database and MaxTotal share one cap): a core at the cap waits, within the request's deadline and Options.Timeout, until a connection is released or a core that has one idle gives up its slot. Set MaxTotal to at least the number of cores that serve database requests; below that, cores share connections by closing and dialing again.

```tin body
let pw = quarry.Getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")
let name = "ana"
let db = postgres.Open(postgres.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:5432", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
let rows = try db.Query("INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES ({name}) RETURNING id")
let id = rows.Rows[0][0].Int()
```

- `type Value enum`: Value is one column of a row.
- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one PostgreSQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(v Value) IsNull() bool`: IsNull reports whether v is NULL.
- `(v Value) Int() i64`: Int is v as an integer (a Text or Float converted, NULL and bad text 0).
- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query returns the first rowset. With no parameters, multiple statements are allowed and all replies are consumed before returning. Integers and booleans use Value.Int; float4/8 use Value.Float; other OIDs (including numeric and bytea) use Value.Text.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec returns the affected count of the last command. Use Query with RETURNING to obtain generated IDs (PostgreSQL has no connection-wide last insert ID).
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin pins a connection until Commit or Rollback. SQL errors abort the transaction until Rollback. Copies share its state: finishing one finishes them all. In request tasks an unfinished transaction is dropped when its owning task/scope ends. Outside tasks always finish explicitly. Tx and its rows belong to the caller's pool.
- `(t mut Tx) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement in the transaction and returns its first rowset.
- `(t mut Tx) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement in the transaction and returns its affected count.
- `(t mut Tx) Commit() !`: Commit makes the transaction's changes permanent. An aborted transaction must be rolled back explicitly; PostgreSQL's implicit COMMIT-to-ROLLBACK is not success.
- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes and releases its connection.

## kafka

Package kafka is an Apache Kafka client: a producer (idempotent by default, with batching and gzip, snappy, lz4 and zstd compression), fetching from partitions (read_committed too), consumer groups with rebalancing, transactions, and administration of topics, partitions, records, groups and configs. It speaks Kafka's binary protocol directly (request versions brokers 2.4 to 4.x accept; run against 3.9 and 4.2), over plain TCP or TLS 1.3, with SASL PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256 or SCRAM-SHA-512.

Each core keeps one connection per broker for each Client. The requests a core serves at the same time share a connection, and sends of the same turn to one partition share a record batch, so a busy service makes few requests. Inside a request task a call waits without blocking the core; outside one it blocks.

```tin body
let bus = kafka.Open(kafka.Options{Brokers: []str{"127.0.0.1:9092"}})
let ack = try bus.Send("orders", kafka.Message{Key: "7", Value: "paid"})
let records = try bus.Fetch("orders", ack.Partition, ack.Offset, 1s)
```

A key picks the partition the way the Java client does (murmur2), so a key lands on the same partition from either. Consumer groups: Group and notes/design_kafka.md (section 3) for where a consumer loop runs. Transactions: Transactional.

- `type TopicSpec struct`: TopicSpec describes a topic to create.
- `type Config struct`: Config is one configuration entry.
- `type Resource enum`: Resource is what a config belongs to.
- `type GroupListing struct`: GroupListing is one group a cluster knows.
- `type GroupMember struct`: GroupMember is one member of a described group.
- `type GroupDescription struct`: GroupDescription is the state of a group.
- `(c Client) CreateTopic(name str, partitions i64, replicas i64) !`: CreateTopic makes a topic. It fails with ErrTopicExists when there already is one.
- `(c Client) CreateTopics(specs []TopicSpec) !`: CreateTopics makes topics; the first failure fails the call (ErrTopicExists for one that exists).
- `(c Client) DeleteTopics(names []str) !`: DeleteTopics removes topics.
- `(c Client) ListTopics() ![]str`: ListTopics is the names of the cluster's topics (internal ones too).
- `(c Client) CreatePartitions(topic str, total i64) !`: CreatePartitions grows topic to total partitions.
- `(c Client) DeleteRecords(topic str, partition i64, before i64) !i64`: DeleteRecords deletes the records of the partition before offset; it returns the partition's new first offset.
- `(c Client) ListGroups() ![]GroupListing`: ListGroups lists the groups of the whole cluster (each broker knows those it coordinates).
- `(c Client) DescribeGroup(group str) !GroupDescription`: DescribeGroup is the state, protocol and members of group.
- `(c Client) DeleteGroups(groups []str) !`: DeleteGroups removes empty groups and their committed offsets.
- `(c Client) DescribeConfigs(kind Resource, name str) ![]Config`: DescribeConfigs is the configuration of a topic or a broker (a broker by its node id).
- `(c Client) SetConfig(kind Resource, name str, key str, value str) !`: SetConfig sets one config of a topic or a broker (IncrementalAlterConfigs: the others stay).
- `(c Client) ResetConfig(kind Resource, name str, key str) !`: ResetConfig removes one config of a topic or a broker, back to its default.
- `(c Client) Close()`: Close closes this core's connections of the client; the next request connects again. Requests waiting on them fail, including one another task is waiting on (a held fetch).
- `type Want struct`: Want names a partition and the offset to read it from.
- `type Part struct`: Part is what a fetch learned about one partition.
- `type Fetched struct`: Fetched is the records of a FetchAll, in partition order, and what it learned of each partition.
- `(c Client) Fetch(topic str, partition i64, offset i64, maxWait i64) ![]Record`: Fetch reads records of topic's partition from offset on. It returns as soon as there are records, or empty after maxWait nanoseconds with none. At most Options.FetchMax bytes of whole record batches come back; a record before offset is skipped. An offset outside the partition fails with ErrOffsetOutOfRange.
- `(c Client) FetchAll(wants []Want, maxWait i64) !Fetched`: FetchAll reads several partitions at once: one request per leader broker, all sent before any is waited for when called inside a task. A partition whose offset is out of range is reported in Parts, not as a fault.
- `(c Client) Offsets(topic str, partition i64) !(i64, i64)`: Offsets returns the first offset still in partition and the offset the next record will get.
- `(c Client) OffsetAt(topic str, partition i64, ts i64) !i64`: OffsetAt is the first offset whose record's timestamp is at or after ts (ms since the epoch), or -1 when every record is older.
- `type Assignor enum`: Assignor is how a group's leader spreads partitions over its members.
- `type Start enum`: Start is where a member starts reading a partition the group has no offset for.
- `type GroupOptions struct`: GroupOptions describe a member.
- `type Group struct`: Group is this core's member of a consumer group.
- `type TopicPartition struct`: TopicPartition names a partition and an offset (a position or a committed offset).
- `(c Client) Group(o GroupOptions) !Group`: Group makes this core's member of a consumer group. It joins on the first Poll.
- `(g Group) MemberID() str`: MemberID is the id the coordinator gave this member ("" before it joined).
- `(g Group) Generation() i64`: Generation is the group generation this member is in (-1 before it joined).
- `(g Group) Assigned() []TopicPartition`: Assigned is the member's partitions with the offset each will be read from next (-1 until known).
- `(g Group) Seek(topic str, partition i64, offset i64) !`: Seek makes the next Poll read the member's partition from offset.
- `(g Group) Heartbeat() !`: Heartbeat tells the coordinator the member is alive (Poll does it when due). A rebalance makes the next Poll rejoin.
- `(g Group) Poll(maxWait i64) ![]Record`: Poll returns the next records of the member's partitions, waiting up to maxWait (less when a heartbeat falls due). It joins the group first, rejoins after a rebalance, heartbeats, and unless ManualCommit is set commits what the previous Poll returned.
- `(g Group) Commit() !`: Commit stores the member's positions (the offsets after the records Poll returned) as the group's committed offsets. A rebalance in the meantime fails it with ErrRebalance.
- `(g Group) CommitOffsets(parts []TopicPartition) !`: CommitOffsets stores the given offsets (each the next offset to read) for the group.
- `(g Group) Close() !`: Close commits (unless ManualCommit) and leaves the group, so its partitions move to the other members at once. A static member (InstanceID) does not leave: its session keeps its partitions for a restart.
- `(c Client) Commit(group str, topic str, partition i64, offset i64) !`: Commit stores offset as group's position in the partition, without being a member (the "simple consumer" commit: generation -1). The offset is the next one to read.
- `(c Client) Committed(group str, topic str, partition i64) !i64`: Committed is the offset group last committed for the partition, or -1 when it has none.
- `type Mechanism enum`: Mechanism is the SASL mechanism used when Options.Username is set.
- `type Acks enum`: Acks says which replicas must have a record before Send returns.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect, and how to produce and fetch.
- `type Client struct`: Client talks to one Kafka cluster. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Ack struct`: Ack says where Send put a record. Offset is -1 with Acks.NoAck, and when an idempotent retry found the batch already written.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the cluster in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(c Client) Partitions(topic str) !i64`: Partitions is how many partitions topic has (asking the cluster). A topic created a moment ago may not be in every broker's metadata yet, so an unknown topic is asked about again for a little while (about two seconds) before the call fails with ErrUnknownTopic.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that a broker answers.
- `(c Client) Send(topic str, m Message) !Ack`: Send appends one record to topic and returns where it went. A record with a key goes to the partition the key hashes to; one without goes to one partition per call, in turn.
- `(c Client) SendTo(topic str, partition i64, m Message) !Ack`: SendTo appends one record to a chosen partition of topic.
- `(c Client) SendBatchTo(topic str, partition i64, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatchTo appends records to a chosen partition of topic, in one batch with what other tasks of this core send there meanwhile.
- `(c Client) SendBatch(topic str, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatch appends records to topic and returns where each went, in order. Records of one partition go in one batch (with what other tasks of this core send meanwhile). A failed batch fails the call; records of other partitions may already be written.
- `type Message struct`: Message is one record to send.
- `type Header struct`: Header is a record header.
- `type Record struct`: Record is a record read from a partition.
- `type Compression enum`: Compression codecs, as the record batch attributes number them.
- `Murmur2(data str) i64`: Murmur2 is the hash Kafka's default partitioner uses for keys (Java's Utils.murmur2), so a key lands on the same partition here as from the Java client.
- `PartitionFor(key str, n i64) i64`: PartitionFor is the partition Kafka's default partitioner picks for key among n partitions.
- `EncodeBatch(ms []Message, now i64, c Compression) str`: EncodeBatch is ms as one record batch (format 2) compressed with c, the bytes Kafka stores and sends, with offsets counted from 0. A message whose Timestamp is 0 gets now (ms since the epoch).
- `DecodeBatches(data str) ![]Record`: DecodeBatches reads the record batches in data, as a Fetch response carries them, with any codec. A batch the data ends in the middle of is dropped; a damaged one, a changed byte (CRC-32C) or an old message format fails. Control batches (transaction markers) are skipped.
- `type Txn struct`: Txn is this core's transactional producer for one transactional id.
- `(c Client) Transactional(txid str, timeout i64) !Txn`: Transactional makes this core's producer for transactional id txid (timeout: how long the broker lets a transaction stay open, default 60 s). It fences any older producer with the same id, and aborts what that one left open.
- `(t Txn) Begin() !`: Begin starts a transaction.
- `(t Txn) Send(topic str, m Message) !Ack`: Send writes one record in the open transaction.
- `(t Txn) SendBatch(topic str, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatch writes records in the open transaction, one batch per partition; readers with ReadCommitted see them only once the transaction commits.
- `(t Txn) SendOffsets(group str, offsets []TopicPartition) !`: SendOffsets commits a consumer group's offsets as part of the open transaction (consume-transform-produce): they become the group's committed offsets only if the transaction commits.
- `(t Txn) Commit() !`: Commit commits the open transaction: its records become visible to ReadCommitted readers and its offsets the group's.
- `(t Txn) Abort() !`: Abort discards the open transaction.

## websocket

Package websocket is the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455): Accept upgrades an anvil request, Dial connects to a server (ws://, or wss:// over TLS 1.3). Messages are text or binary; pings are answered and fragments joined inside Read. Inside a request task a Read waits without blocking the core, so one core holds many idle connections.

```tin
fn handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	let ws = websocket.Accept(q, mut w) catch _ { return }
	ws.Each(echo) catch _ {}
}

fn echo(ws websocket.Conn, m websocket.Message) ! {
	try ws.WriteText("echo: {m.Data}")
}
```

- `type Message struct`: Message is one complete message.
- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a WebSocket connection.
- `Accept(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) !Conn`: Accept completes the opening handshake for request q and takes over its connection. A request that is not a WebSocket handshake gets a 400 (426 for another version) in w and fails. The connection and its buffers close when the handler returns.
- `Dial(url str) !Conn`: Dial connects to a ws:// or wss:// URL ("ws://host:port/path"); wss:// verifies the server's certificate against the system's roots. Close it when finished; inside a request task, it is also closed automatically when its scope ends.
- `DialTLS(url str, cfg tls.Config) !Conn`: DialTLS is Dial with the TLS configuration of a wss:// URL (RootCAs, Timeout for the handshake, InsecureSkipVerify for tests); the server name is the URL's host, and ALPN offers http/1.1 whatever cfg.ALPN says (the upgrade is HTTP/1.1).
- `(c Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetMaxMessage(n i64)`: SetMaxMessage sets the largest message Read accepts (default 16 MiB); a bigger one closes the connection with 1009.
- `(c Conn) WriteText(s str) !`: WriteText sends s as a text message.
- `(c Conn) WriteBinary(b []u8) !`: WriteBinary sends b as a binary message.
- `(c Conn) Ping() !`: Ping sends a ping; the peer's pong is consumed by Read.
- `(c Conn) CloseWith(code i64, reason str) !`: CloseWith sends a close frame with code and reason; the connection then only drains.
- `(c Conn) Close()`: Close sends a normal close (1000) and, for a client, closes the connection.
- `IsClosed(err fault) bool`: IsClosed reports whether err is the normal end of a connection: the peer closed it.
- `(c Conn) Read() !Message`: Read returns the next message; it answers pings and joins fragments on the way. When the peer closes, it answers the close and fails with "websocket: closed (code)". The returned message lives in the caller's pool. For a long-lived stream, use Each to reset message allocations after every callback without invalidating the Conn.
- `(c Conn) Each(h fn(Conn, Message) !) !`: Each reads messages and calls h until a read or callback fails. Every callback has a reusable message pool: use keep() to retain its data after the callback returns. The Conn and all objects allocated before Each remain valid. Callbacks may wait. A closed peer returns the same IsClosed fault as Read; callback faults propagate.

## atomic

Package atomic has counters and flags that every core may change at once. Keep one in a `shared let` (a value every core reads, built once before the cores start), as in `shared let hits = atomic.NewInt(0)`, and call `hits.Add(1)` from any core; the operations are indivisible and ordered (sequentially consistent) across the whole process. A value made anywhere else (in a handler, in a per-core global) lives in one core's memory and must not be shared. Integers and flags only: build anything bigger with relay messages or per-core state.

- `type Int struct`: Int is an integer that cores read and change with indivisible operations.
- `NewInt(v i64) Int`: NewInt returns an Int holding v.
- `(c Int) Load() i64`: Load returns the value.
- `(c Int) Store(v i64)`: Store sets the value to v.
- `(c Int) Add(n i64) i64`: Add adds n (negative to subtract) and returns the new value.
- `(c Int) Swap(v i64) i64`: Swap sets the value to v and returns the one it replaced.
- `(c Int) CompareSwap(old i64, next i64) bool`: CompareSwap sets the value to next if it is old, and reports whether it did.
- `type Bool struct`: Bool is a flag that cores read and change with indivisible operations.
- `NewBool(v bool) Bool`: NewBool returns a Bool holding v.
- `(c Bool) Load() bool`: Load returns the flag.
- `(c Bool) Store(v bool)`: Store sets the flag to v.
- `(c Bool) Swap(v bool) bool`: Swap sets the flag to v and returns the value it replaced.
- `(c Bool) CompareSwap(old bool, next bool) bool`: CompareSwap sets the flag to next if it is old, and reports whether it did.
