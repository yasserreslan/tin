# Tin tooling: commands, builds, tests, benchmarks

Everything lives in one tree (`~/Desktop/tin`). Nothing outside it is needed to build
Tin: the checked-in seed compiler builds the compiler, which builds everything else. Go
is used only by the HTTP conformance tools, benchmarks and reference programs; Docker only
for Linux testing.

## 1. Installing

For prebuilt archives, the checksum-verifying installer and the multi-architecture
Docker builder, see [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md). The commands below install
from a source checkout.

```sh
make install                    # builds bin/tinc from seed/ and links `tin` into $(PREFIX)/bin
make install PREFIX=~/.local    # a per-user install: no privileges, ~/.local/bin must be on PATH
make && sudo make install       # a system-wide install where $(PREFIX)/bin is root-owned
```

`PREFIX` defaults to `/opt/homebrew` on a Mac with Homebrew there and to `/usr/local`
everywhere else (Linux, a Mac without Homebrew); an explicit `PREFIX` always wins.
`$(PREFIX)/bin` is created if missing. On most Linux systems `/usr/local/bin` is
root-owned, so either install per user or build first as yourself and run only the
install step with `sudo` (so `bin/` stays yours). The link points into this tree:
moving or deleting the tree breaks it.

`tin` is a shell script (`./tin`); `bin/tinc` is the compiler binary.

## 2. The `tin` command

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `tin FILE.tin [ARGS...]` | compile and run (temporary executable, removed after) |
| `tin run A.tin B.tin -- ARGS` | compile several files as one program and run it |
| `tin build FILE.tin... [-o OUT] [--target T]` | write an executable (default name: the first file without `.tin`) |
| `tin asm FILE.tin...` | print the generated ARM64 assembly (clang syntax) |
| `tin audit secrets [-edition 1] FILE.tin...` | check the program and list every place a `secret` leaves the checker's protection: each `reveal(x)` and each secret passed to a library parameter declared `secret`, as `file:line:col: ...` sorted by position, then a count; exit status 1 (with the errors) when the program does not check |
| `tin test [-bench] [DIR]` | build DIR (default `.`) with its `*_test.tin` files and run every `TestXxx(t mut crucible.T)`, then `BenchmarkXxx(b mut crucible.B)` with `-bench`; exit status 1 when a test fails, 2 for a wrong test signature (see §5.1) |
| `tin vendor [DIR]` | copy every package `DIR/tin.mod` requires (transitively, from local source directories) into `DIR/vendor/<path>` and write `DIR/tin.lock` with each vendored file's SHA-256 (see §2.1) |
| `tin suite` | run the compiler's strict test suite (`tools/v2test.sh`) |
| `tin bootstrap` | rebuild the compiler with itself; the binaries must be identical |
| `tin version` | version and compiler checksum |

Targets (`--target`): `darwin-arm64` (default on a Mac), `linux-arm64` (default on
arm64 Linux), `linux-amd64` (supported and tested natively). Cross-compiling needs nothing extra: the
compiler contains every backend and writes Mach-O or ELF itself.

Programs without a `package` clause use the legacy syntax; `tin` adds `lib/std.tin` to
them.

### 2.1 Dependencies: `tin.mod`, `tin vendor`, `tin.lock`

A dependency is imported by path (`import "github.com/ana/geo"`) and read only from
`vendor/github.com/ana/geo` next to the program. Builds never fetch anything. The details
are in [PACKAGES.md](PACKAGES.md).

```sh
cat tin.mod
#   module example.com/app
#   require github.com/ana/geo ../geo        local directory: a checkout or a mirror
tin vendor                                   # vendor/github.com/ana/geo/... and tin.lock
tin build main.tin                           # offline; refuses a vendored file whose hash changed
```

With a `tin.lock`, every vendored file must have the hash the lock records, and every
other listed file is checked too. A changed byte stops the build before the file is
parsed: `E111 LOCK_MISMATCH` names the file and both hashes. Review the change, then run
`tin vendor` again to accept it.

## 3. The compiler, `tinc`

```
tinc [-o OUT] [-S] [-target darwin-arm64|linux-arm64|linux-amd64] FILE.tin...
```

- `-o OUT`: write the executable (default `a.out`). `-S`: print assembly instead.
- `-audit-secrets`: check the program and print its secret audit instead of building
  (`tin audit secrets`; LANGUAGE.md §17).
- The standard library is found through `$TIN_ROOT` or, without it, relative to the
  executable (`<root>/bin/tinc` means `<root>/lib`). The `tin` script sets `TIN_ROOT`.
- Strict programs get the package `lib/runtime/` (its `*_<os>.tin` and `*_<os>_<arch>.tin`
  files only for the target) automatically; imports are resolved as in LANGUAGE.md §1.
- Errors print as `file:line:col: error E502 TYPE_ARG_COUNT: message` (code and name from
  [ERRORS.md](ERRORS.md); errors not yet given a code print `error: message`), every error
  in one run; the exit code is 1. A compiler crash prints a backtrace only under a debugger (see §8).
- `-hash FILE...` prints `<sha256> FILE` for each file (the `tin.lock` lines `tin vendor`
  writes) and builds nothing.
- `TINC_TRACE=1` prints each function as it is generated (to find which one crashes the
  code generator).

## 4. Make targets

| target | does |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make bin/tinc` | build the compiler from the host's seed (`seed/tinc-<os>-<arch>`) |
| `make bootstrap` | `bin/tinc` builds `bin/s2/tinc`, which builds `bin/s3/tinc`; they must be byte-identical |
| `make seed` | bootstrap, then refresh the host's seed from `bin/s3/tinc` |
| `make test` | the strict suite |
| `make linux-test` | cross-compile every strict test for linux-arm64 and run it in an arm64 container (`tools/linuxtest.sh`) |
| `make linux-bootstrap` | cross-compile a Linux compiler, then in the container it must rebuild itself identically; refreshes `seed/tinc-linux-arm64` |
| `make linux-amd64-bootstrap` | the same for x86-64 in `tin-debian-amd64` (emulated on an arm64 Mac); refreshes `seed/tinc-linux-amd64` |
| `make bench` | the legacy CPU benchmarks vs Go (`bench/run.py`) |
| `make install` | link `tin` into `$(PREFIX)/bin` (created if needed; see §1 for the default) |
| `make dist` | package the native compiler, library and sources in a versioned archive with a SHA-256 checksum |
| `make print-VAR` | print a Makefile variable (e.g. `make print-SELF`, the compiler's sources) |
| `make clean` | remove `bin/` |

Rule of the tree: before anything is called done, `make bootstrap` reaches the fixed
point and `make test` (plus `make linux-test` when the library or backend changed)
passes.

## 5. Tests

| suite | where | how it checks |
|---|---|---|
| strict tests | `tests/v2/*.tin` | `tools/v2test.sh`: compiles and runs each, sorts the output and compares it with `NAME.out`; `NAME_bad.tin` must fail to compile with exactly `NAME_bad.err` |
| diagnostic codes | `docs/ERRORS.md` | `tools/v2test.sh` runs `tools/ci/diagnostics_check.py`: the compiler's codes, the page and the `.err` files agree, and every example on the page compiles to exactly the output it shows |
| assembly checks | `tests/v2/*_asm.tin` + `*_asm.check` | `tools/v2test.sh`: compiles with `-S` and matches the listing against ordered `CHECK:`/`CHECK-NOT:` lines, lit-style; a `[arm64]`/`[amd64]` line selects a section, lines before any section apply to every CPU |
| Linux | same files | `tools/linuxtest.sh`: cross-compiles for linux-arm64, runs in `tin-debian-arm64`, compares with the same `.out` files |
| HTTP conformance | `bench/http/conformance` | 26 edge cases against a running server: `bin/conformance -addr 127.0.0.1:9180 -pid PID` |
| x86-64 encoder | `tools/x64fuzz` | `tools/x64fuzz/run.sh [COUNT] [SEED]`: random instructions vs `x86_64-linux-gnu-objdump` |
| stdlib vs Go | `bench/ref/NAME/main.go` | the same cases written with Go's library; outputs diffed (see notes/stdlib_verified.md) |

### 5.1 Testing your own code: `*_test.tin`

```tin
// geo_test.tin, next to geo.tin (same package; private names are visible)
package geo

import "crucible"

func TestArea(t mut crucible.T) {
	crucible.Equal(mut t, "2x3", Area(2, 3), 6)   // any comparable type
	t.True("clamp", clampPos(-1) == 0)
	t.NoFault("parse", err)
	if t.Failed() {
		t.Log("printed only when the test fails")
	}
}

func BenchmarkArea(b mut crucible.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		Area(i, 3)
	}
}
```

`tin test ./geo` prints `--- PASS: TestArea` / `--- FAIL: ...` with the failure messages,
then `PASS: N tests` or `FAIL: ...` (exit status 1). `tin test -bench ./geo` also runs each
benchmark, doubling `b.N` until it takes a second, and prints ns/op. `*_test.tin` files are
never part of a normal build or import. Underneath, `tin test` writes a runner calling each
test through `crucible.Run` and compiles the package with `tinc -entry pkg.TinTestMain`.

As in Go, a test is a `TestXxx` (or benchmark `BenchmarkXxx`) in a `*_test.tin` file whose
`Xxx` does not start with a lowercase letter (`Testify` is an ordinary function). It must be
declared on one line as `func TestXxx(name mut crucible.T) {` (`mut crucible.B` for a
benchmark); any other signature is reported as `FILE:LINE: wrong signature for TestXxx`
with exit status 2, so no test is skipped silently.

Adding a strict test: write `tests/v2/NAME.tin` with deterministic output (no times,
addresses or map-order dependence beyond what sorting hides), run it, check every line
by hand, then save `bin/t | sort > tests/v2/NAME.out`. `v2test.sh` never creates
expected files itself.

Adding a compiler error: report it with `err_code(pos, "E5NN NAME")` (or `err_code_at`,
`err_code_quoted`), reusing the code of the rule it enforces or adding one: a new entry in
`docs/ERRORS.md`, in code order, with the rule, an example, the exact output and the fix.
Never renumber or reuse a code; when a diagnostic goes away, its entry stays, marked `Retired:`.

Writing to files in tests: use paths under `/tmp/tin-test-*` (they work on macOS and
Linux).

## 6. Linux on a Mac (Docker)

Images (built locally, all native arm64 except where noted):

| image | contents | used for |
|---|---|---|
| `tin-debian-arm64` | debian:bookworm-slim (glibc 2.36) | running tests |
| `tin-bench-arm64` | the above + wrk, procps | benchmarks, conformance |
| `tin-debian-amd64` | debian:bookworm-slim amd64 (emulated) | x86-64 correctness |
| `golang:1.27` | Debian 13 + Go + gcc | C probes, Go builds |

Re-create them with:

```sh
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 debian:bookworm-slim && docker tag debian:bookworm-slim tin-debian-arm64
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 debian:bookworm-slim && docker tag debian:bookworm-slim tin-debian-amd64
printf 'FROM tin-debian-arm64\nRUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq wrk procps\n' | docker build -t tin-bench-arm64 -
```

(after pulling both platforms, the bare `debian:bookworm-slim` tag points at the last
one pulled: always use the `tin-*` tags or `--platform`.)

Running something by hand:

```sh
tin build --target linux-arm64 app.tin -o bin/linux/app
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/bin/linux":/w tin-debian-arm64 /w/app
```

Go binaries for the container: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bin/linux/x ./dir`.

## 7. Benchmarks

| script | measures |
|---|---|
| `bench/http/run_wrk.sh CORES THREADS CONNS SECS ROUNDS` | anvil vs fasthttp vs net/http on macOS under wrk: req/s, p99, req per server CPU-second, RSS (medians) |
| `bench/http/run_pipelined.sh "1 2 4"` | the same with 16 pipelined requests per write (wrk Lua script) |
| `bin/linux/bench.sh` (inside `tin-bench-arm64`) | the same comparison on Linux |
| `bench/v2/NAME.tin` + `NAME.go` | CPU benchmarks; build both, time with `/usr/bin/time -l`, outputs must be identical |
| `bench/dispatch/dispatch.tin` | shape dispatch against a hand-written call (Tin only, no Go twin): ns/op of each and their ratio; see PERFORMANCE.md section 5 |
| `bench/dispatch/dyn.tin` | dynamic shape dispatch against a direct method call; reports ns/op and pool bytes, with a paired assembly check in `tests/v2/shapes_dyn_asm.tin` |
| `examples/demo.tin` + `examples/demo_go` | the mixed demo (primes, sort, SHA-256, JSON, maps), self-timing |
| `bench/http/hammer` | a Go load generator (wrk-like) with exact latency histograms |
| `bench/router/router.tin` + `bench/router/go` | routing cost with 1, 20 and 200 routes: a lookup (`Match`) and a whole request through the router (`Run`), against chi's `Find` and `ServeHTTP` |
| `bench/http/routes.tin` | `/json` and `/plaintext` behind a router of `ROUTES` routes (port 9180, like `examples/api.tin`), for routing inside a served request |
| `bench/v04/run.py` | `GET /users/{id}` through Redis over MySQL, Tin vs Go + chi under wrk2: max req/s, req per CPU-second, p50/p99/p99.9 at a fixed rate, RSS (needs Redis, MySQL seeded by `bench/v04/seed.py`, and `WRK2`) |

Servers used: `examples/api.tin` (port 9180, `TIN_CORES=n`), `bench/http/fast` (fasthttp,
9182), `bench/http/gonet` (net/http, 9181), with `GOMAXPROCS=n`. Results and analysis:
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).

## 8. Debugging

| tool | use |
|---|---|
| `tin asm file.tin` / `tinc -S` | read the generated code |
| `tools/try.sh COMPILER FILE.tin` | compile and run; if the compiler crashes, print its backtrace under lldb |
| `tools/crash.sh PROGRAM ARGS` | run under lldb and print a Tin backtrace on a crash (`tools/tinbt.py` walks frame pointers) |
| `TINC_TRACE=1 tinc ...` | which function the backend was generating |
| panics | print the message and a backtrace (inlined frames are missing) |
| `lldb bin/t` | symbols are present (function names as `pkg.Name`, `Type.Method`) |

A compiler change that breaks the compiler itself: build with the previous good
compiler (`bin/s3/tinc` or the seed), never overwrite the seed until `make bootstrap`
passes.

## 9. Repository layout

```
tin                 the tin command (shell script)
Makefile            builds, bootstraps, tests
selfhost/           the compiler, in legacy Tin (COMPILER.md)
lib/<package>/      the runtime and each standard-library package, one directory each (lib/README.md)

seed/               tinc-darwin-arm64, tinc-linux-arm64, tinc-linux-amd64: the compilers that start a build
examples/           api.tin (HTTP server), tasks.tin, redis.tin, mysql.tin, websocket.tin, demo.tin, demo_go/
bench/              v2/ CPU benchmarks, http/ HTTP benchmarks and tools, v04/ the service benchmark, ref/ Go references

notes/              design notes, plans, verification records, roadmap
bin/                build output (ignored)
```

## 10. Version control

The tree is ready to become a git repository: `.gitignore` excludes `bin/` and scratch
output, every generated file can be regenerated (`make`, `tools/gendoc.py`,
`tools/gencoverage.tin`), seeds are
plain files, and no script depends on a machine-specific path.

```sh
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Tin v0.3"
```

Suggested workflow after that: one branch per milestone; a branch merges only when
`make bootstrap`, `make test` and `make linux-test` pass; seeds change only in commits
where the bootstrap passed, together with the compiler change that needed them.

## 11. Regenerating the docs

`python3 tools/gendoc.py` rewrites `docs/STDLIB.md` from the comments in `lib/*.tin`
(package comment, then one line per exported function, type and constant). Write a
one-line comment above every exported declaration.

`bin/tinc -o /tmp/gencoverage tools/gencoverage.tin && /tmp/gencoverage` rewrites
`docs/COVERAGE.md` from the maintained inventory in `notes/coverage.md`.

`python3 tools/gen_unicode.py` rewrites `lib/glyph/tables.tin` and `lib/runtime/printable.tin` (the Unicode
tables) from Go's `unicode/tables.go`; it needs a Go tree only to read that one file.

## CPU cancellation safepoints

`tin build --polls FILE.tin -o app` and `tin run --polls FILE.tin` enable CPU
cancellation safepoints (`bin/tinc -polls` directly). `TINC_POLLS=1` enables the same
compiler option for build scripts and benchmark harnesses. Polls are experimental and
opt-in because native Linux measurements exceed the 2% performance budget; see
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#cpu-cancellation-safepoints).

With polls, loop back-edges and function entries in user code observe watchdog cancellation.
A `within` deadline unwinds to its owner, runs defers, and returns its fault. A request
spinning past its deadline gets HTTP 504 and the core serves queued requests. Linux SIGTERM
drain also stops a spinning request at the grace deadline. `@nopoll fn kernel(...) ...`
(edition 1) omits polls in that function; calls into other functions may still poll. Trusted
`lib/runtime/` functions never poll. Without the option, waits still observe deadlines and
cancellation; CPU-bound code has no cancellation guarantee.
