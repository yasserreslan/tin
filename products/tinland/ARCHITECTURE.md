# Tinland: architecture

Tinland is an editor written entirely in Tin. It is built the way Zed is: a small platform layer, its own GPU-drawn UI
framework, and the editor's features as packages on top of it. This page says what each package is for and what may import
what, so the product can grow (a project panel, search, a terminal, extensions) without turning into one large file.

## The packages

```
products/tinland/
  main.tin        package main: the entry point; reads the command line and starts the app
  app/            the application: the window loop, the menu bar, the application's settings
  workspace/      what a window holds: title bar, docks (the project panel), panes with tabs, the status bar   (planned)
  editor/         the text editor: a buffer, its view, selections, completion, diagnostics, commands
  project/        folders: the file tree, ignore rules, project-wide search                                       (planned)
  ui/             the UI framework: geometry, colors, text, a tree of elements, layout, input, focus, themes      (planned)
  language/       what Tinland knows about Tin: asking tinc for declarations and errors, building, running, formatting
  tests/          scripts, fixtures and golden output for the macOS tests (run.sh)
  vscode/         the VS Code extension (separate, not part of the application)

packages/
  appkit/         the macOS binding: windows, events, menus, panels, the clipboard, Objective-C classes defined from Tin
  metal/          the Metal binding and the GPU canvas the UI framework draws on                                   (planned)
  textedit/       the text buffer engine and the Tin syntax highlighter (no UI, no operating system)
  tinsym/         the compiler's declarations and errors, name resolution and completion (shared with tin lsp)
  tinjson/        a JSON reader and writer
  tinfmt/         the whitespace formatter (shared with tin fmt)
```

Zed's crates and ours: `gpui` is `ui` over `metal` and `appkit`; `editor`, `project`, `workspace`, `language`, `text` are the
packages of the same name (`text` is `textedit`); its `lsp` client is `language` once it speaks the Language Server Protocol
(today it runs tinc directly); `theme` and `ui` components live in `ui`.

## Layers

A package may import only what is below it:

```
main
  app
    workspace
      editor      project
        ui          language
          metal, appkit, textedit, tinsym, tinjson, tinfmt     (packages/, no knowledge of Tinland)
```

- **`packages/`** know nothing of Tinland. `appkit` and `metal` are the only code that touches the operating system; a Linux
  or Windows port is another binding with the same shape plus a backend in `ui`.
- **`ui`** knows nothing of editing: it draws, lays out and routes input. **`editor`** and **`project`** are built from `ui`
  elements and know nothing of each other; **`workspace`** puts them in a window.
- **`language`** has no windows: paths and text in, declarations, errors and output back.
- A feature gets a package of its own when it has its own state and tests (a terminal, a git panel), not a folder inside
  another package.

## Today and next

The window is built the way Zed's is, with one difference that comes from Tin's memory model (below).

- **Callbacks and classes**: `@callback` lets AppKit call Tin functions and `appkit.NewClass` defines Objective-C classes from
  Tin. `gpuwin` defines the window's view and delegate; AppKit delivers every key and mouse event, menu choice and close request
  to them. Menus are real: each item's action is a method of the delegate.
- **A GPU canvas** (`metal`): one pipeline draws every frame in one call: rounded rectangles, outlines, clipping, and sprites
  from a glyph atlas that CoreText fills on demand (text, with the system's fallback fonts, and SF Symbol icons).
- **The UI framework** (`ui`): a tree of elements built every frame (boxes with flex layout, text, icons, scroll areas, custom
  areas), laid out, painted to a list of commands and recorded for hit testing. It has no GPU in it, so it is tested everywhere.
- **`workspace`**: the title bar, the left dock (project, git, outline, search, problems), tabs, the editor, the output panel,
  the status bar, the picker (go to file, command palette) and the project search. **`project`** is the folder tree with ignore
  rules, file operations, fuzzy matching and the search itself; it is portable.
- **`terminal`**: the screen model of a VT100 style terminal (the grid, colors, scroll back); with `appkit.StartShell` (a
  shell on a pseudo terminal) it is the terminal panel. The screen model is portable and tested.
- **`lsp`**: a Language Server Protocol client (JSON-RPC over pipes, never waiting: the loop polls it): completion and diagnostics from gopls and other servers; Tin files use the compiler (`language`, `tinsym`) instead.
- **`editor`**: the text area (the buffer is `textedit`), its keys, completion, diagnostics, navigation and running a file.

Where Zed keeps its state in `Rc` cells that live as long as they are referenced, Tin's request pool and ingot heap make a
global that is changed after start-up pay a `keep()` on every store. So the callbacks only write down what happened (a queue of
numbers, `gpuwin.Next`) and the program's state sits in the plain locals of `app.Run`, which takes the queue between frames
and draws each frame in an `arena`, so a frame leaves nothing behind (memory stays flat: 600 frames at 60 per second moved the
resident size by nothing). The loop waits for the next AppKit event with `gpuwin.Pump`; AppKit calls the callbacks while it
handles the event.

Still to build: hover and go to definition through language servers, a debugger, extensions.
