# Tin

Tin is a compiled language for servers and tools, with Go's packages and blocks and a syntax
of its own for what Go does not have (edition 1: `fn`, `let`/`mut`, `match`, `within`, `scope`). Linux arm64/amd64 is the
production target: deployments and benchmarks are Linux. macOS arm64 is supported for
development (writing, building and testing on a Mac) only. It is meant to be written by AI, so it trades human convenience for speed and robustness: the compiler
rejects ignored errors, nil dereferences, request memory leaking into long-lived state, and
shared mutable state between threads.

- **Self-hosted**: the compiler (`tinc`, about 19k lines of Tin) compiles itself to a
  byte-identical binary, on macOS and on Linux, and writes signed Mach-O or ELF executables
  with its own assembler and linkers. No clang, ld, Go or libc headers are needed, and
  cross-compiling is one flag (`tin build --target linux-arm64`).
- **No GC, no pauses**: request-scoped bump pools plus a long-lived per-core heap, with a
  compile-time check that request memory never escapes without `keep()`.
- **Thread per core, share nothing**: per-core globals, `hearth` cores, `relay` messages,
  and an HTTP server (`anvil`: HTTP/1.1 and h2c HTTP/2, gRPC-ready trailers) with one
  kqueue/epoll event loop per core and a router.
- **Strict**: sized integers with no implicit conversions, non-nil references, `?T`
  optionals, faults that must be handled (`try`), mandatory bounds checks (removed when
  proven safe), `defer`, generics by monomorphization.
- **Servers in the language**: deadlines (`within 200ms { }`), budgets (`limit memory 4mb`),
  structured tasks (`scope`, `parallel`, `select`), panic guards, `use`/`on` lifecycles,
  `secret` values and bounded strings are checked by the compiler.

```tin
package main

import "anvil"
import "argo"
import "say"
import "tide"

type Message struct {
	message str
}

fn hello(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	w.Json()
	argo.Put(mut w.Body, Message{message: "Hello, World!"})
}

fn slow(id str) !str {
	try tide.Wait(10ms)
	return "user {id}"
}

fn user(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	let id = q.PathParam("id")
	let text = within 200ms {
		try slow(id)
	} catch err {
		w.Status(504)
		"timed out: {err}"
	}
	w.Text(text)
}

fn main() {
	let r = anvil.NewRouter()
	r.Get("/json", hello)
	r.Get(`/users/{id}`, user) // a raw string: in "..." the {id} would interpolate
	r.Serve(":8080") catch err {
		say.Line("server:", err)
	}
}
```

## Quick start

Install a release without a local toolchain:

```sh
curl -fL https://github.com/yasserreslan/tin/releases/latest/download/install.sh -o install-tin.sh
sh install-tin.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.tin/bin:$PATH"
```

Or compile in Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" ghcr.io/yasserreslan/tin:latest build app.tin -o app
```

See [distribution and containers](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md) for checksums, upgrades and
multi-stage Dockerfiles. To build and test from a source checkout:

```sh
make install                  # build bin/tinc from the seed and put `tin` on the PATH
tin examples/api.tin          # compile and run
tin build app.tin -o app      # native executable
tin test ./mypkg              # run mypkg's *_test.tin tests (Go style)
tin fix -edition 1 old.tin    # rewrite edition-0 (Go-like) code to edition 1
tin suite                     # the compiler's strict test suite (tests/v2)
make test                     # the strict suite
make bootstrap                # tinc rebuilds itself twice; the binaries must be identical
```

`tools/ci/`. Core library behavior is also checked against Go equivalents in
`bench/ref/`; see [notes/stdlib_verified.md](notes/stdlib_verified.md).

## Performance

**Policy:** reference benchmarks are measured on Linux; macOS is a development platform
and its numbers are not reference results (see
[docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#benchmark-policy)). The tables after the v0.4
service benchmark were measured on the macOS development machine before this policy and
are kept until Linux reference runs replace them; the Linux workflow `.github/workflows/bench-linux.yml`
tracks Tin/Go ratios on GitHub's Linux runners meanwhile.

**v0.4 service benchmark on Linux** (`GET /users/{id}` through Redis over MySQL, Tin vs Go
+ chi under wrk2, `bench/v04`): GitHub `ubuntu-24.04` runner, AMD EPYC 7763 (4 vCPUs),
Linux 6.17, Go 1.26.8, each server on 2 pinned cores, wrk2/Redis/MySQL on the other 2,
median of 5 alternating rounds
([run](https://github.com/yasserreslan/tin/actions/runs/37210593145)). On a shared runner
only the Tin/Go ratios are meaningful (throughput above 1 and latency below 1 favour Tin):

| scenario | max req/s | req per CPU-s | p99 at a fixed rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| cached (Redis hit) | **3.72** | **3.60** | **0.56** |
| db (MySQL prepared statement) | **1.23** | **1.75** | 1.30 |
| mixed (0.5% 50 ms `/slow`) | **3.56** | **3.56** | 0.99 |

The db p99 swings between runs (0.42 in the previous run): MySQL dominates it, so it is
not a win either way. Tin uses more memory here (about 50 MB against 25 MB RSS). The mixed p99 is equal because
wrk2's requests wait behind `/slow` on their own connection; details and absolute numbers
are in [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#v04-service-benchmark-linux).

Apple M3 Pro (5 performance + 6 efficiency cores), Go 1.26, fasthttp 1.74, wrk 4.2, the
load generator on the same machine. Run with `bench/http/run_wrk.sh` and
`bench/http/run_pipelined.sh`.

**HTTP, 1 server core, wrk -t4 -c100, median of 3** (the server is the bottleneck):

| server | /json req/s | p99 | /plaintext req/s | p99 | memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **anvil** | **316k** | **0.63 ms** | **324k** | **0.60 ms** | 3–6 MB |
| fasthttp | 231k | 0.77 ms | 236k | 1.17 ms | 9–13 MB |
| net/http | 138k | 1.33 ms | 141k | 1.51 ms | 13–14 MB |

**HTTP, 16 pipelined requests per write** (TechEmpower plaintext style):

| server cores | anvil | fasthttp | net/http |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **2.98M** | 1.40M | 0.19M |
| 2 | **4.46M** | 2.83M | 0.33M |
| 4 | **3.69M** | 3.45M | 0.65M |

**HTTP on Linux** (arm64 Debian container on the same Mac, wrk -t4 -c100, median of 3):

| server cores | anvil | fasthttp | net/http |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 /json | **414k**, p99 **0.44 ms** | 243k, 0.89 ms | 107k, 2.03 ms |
| 2 /json | **859k**, p99 **0.32 ms** | 378k, 0.71 ms | 181k, 1.71 ms |
| 4 /json | **855k**, p99 **0.79 ms** | 719k, 1.84 ms | 406k, 1.42 ms |

At 4 cores on `/plaintext`, with accept-time balancing: anvil 883k req/s, p99 0.42 ms
against fasthttp 866k, 0.99 ms.

On macOS without pipelining, at 2 or more server cores wrk itself saturates this machine (all three
servers land at 220–260k req/s, and net/http comes out about 10% ahead at 4 cores because
its bursty replies let wrk batch). Per CPU-second of server time, anvil serves 328k
requests at one core against 237k for fasthttp and 143k for net/http.

**CPU benchmarks** (bench/v2, best of 3, identical output to Go). The mixed demo
(`examples/demo.tin` vs `examples/demo_go`: primes, sort, SHA-256, JSON, maps) runs in
0.80 s against Go's 1.01 s.

| benchmark | Tin | Go | Tin/Go |
|---|---|---|---|
| binary-trees (depth 18) | 0.31 s | 0.95 s | **0.33** |
| sort 10M i64, stable | 0.68 s | 2.65 s | **0.26** |
| sort 10M i64 | 0.60 s | 0.68 s | **0.89** |
| JSON encode (argo vs encoding/json) | 1.08 s | 1.83 s | **0.59** |
| SHA-256, 100 MB (CPU SHA instructions) | 0.037 s | 0.035 s | 1.05 |
| hash map 5M i64 | 0.54 s | 0.60 s | **0.90** |
| spectral-norm 5500 | 1.30 s | 1.30 s | 1.00 |
| mandelbrot 4000 | 0.69 s | 0.67 s | 1.03 |
| sieve 100M | 0.48 s | 0.46 s | 1.04 |
| LCG loop | 1.26 s | 1.21 s | 1.04 |
| n-body 50M | 1.89 s | 1.76 s | 1.07 |
| fannkuch 11 | 1.97 s | 1.72 s | 1.15 |
| string building 10M | 0.07 s | 0.06 s | 1.17 |

binary-trees uses 917 MB against Go's 37 MB: a plain program never resets its pool
(servers reset it per request). Binaries are tens of KB (Go: megabytes).

## Status and next steps

Targets: linux-arm64 and linux-amd64 (production and benchmarks) and darwin-arm64
(development only), each tested natively in CI, and the compiler self-hosts on all three;
see [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md).

v0.4: each anvil request runs in its own task with its own stack and pool, so a handler
that waits (`tide.Wait`, `wire`, `quarry` files, `redis`, `mysql`, `postgres`, `websocket`) lets its
core serve other requests meanwhile. Sockets are non-blocking; file I/O goes through each
core's io_uring on Linux (helper threads elsewhere and for FIFOs and FUSE mounts), macOS DNS
to helper threads; every request has a deadline. Statements and commands are `query`
values, so a value is always sent apart from the text. See
[docs/RUNTIME.md](docs/RUNTIME.md) and [notes/roadmap.md](notes/roadmap.md).
