## say

Built into the compiler (formatting by static type, no reflection): `say.Line(a, b...)`, `say.Text(...)`, `say.Out(format, ...)`, `say.Fmt(format, ...) str`, `say.Str(x) str`, `say.Fault(format, ...) fault`, `say.To(fd, ...)`, `say.LineTo(fd, ...)`. See toolchain/docs/LANGUAGE.md.

## fault

Package fault is fault chains and the standard sentinels, like Go's errors package: Wrap adds context and keeps the cause, Is walks the chain comparing identity, Join keeps several faults reachable. The runtime's sentinels are the variables Canceled, DeadlineExceeded, LimitExceeded, Overloaded, Draining and Panic; a package declares its own as `let ErrX = fault("msg")`. A function that makes a fault is declared ! here: its fault is the value (fail it, keep it in a variable, or test it). Layout and identities: design/interface_faults.md.

- `Wrap(err fault, msg str) !`: Wrap is err with msg in front ("msg: cause"), err reachable as its cause; nil when err is nil.
- `Is(err fault, target fault) bool`: Is reports whether err or a fault in its chain (causes and joined faults) is target: the same sentinel, or the same fault.
- `Cause(err fault) !`: Cause is the fault err wraps; nil when it wraps none (and for nil and a Join).
- `Join(errs []fault) !`: Join is one fault holding every non-nil fault of errs, each reachable by Is, the messages on separate lines; nil when all are nil.
- `Message(err fault) str`: Message is the full message of err ("outer: inner" for a wrapped fault), "" for nil.
- `Backtrace(err fault) str`: Backtrace is the backtrace text of the panic in err's chain (a fault.Panic), "" for none.

## argo

Package argo writes JSON. argo.Put(b, v) appends v to the []u8 buffer b; the compiler generates a dedicated encoder for v's type (fields in declaration order, no reflection, no allocation). The w* writers below are what those encoders call. argo.Get(s, v) fills v from the JSON text s with a decoder generated the same way; it returns a fault for arrays and objects nested more than 512 deep, as each level takes stack, and leaves v unchanged on any fault. argo.GetStrict(s, v) also rejects unknown and duplicate members.

- `Put(b mut []u8, v i64)`: Put appends v as JSON to b. The compiler replaces every call with a typed encoder.
- `Str(b mut []u8, s str)`: Str appends s as a JSON string.
- `Raw(b mut []u8, s str)`: Raw appends already-encoded JSON text.
- `type Parser struct`

## io

Package io declares the streaming shapes: a type satisfies Reader, Writer, Closer or Seeker by having the methods, with no declaration, and compositions like ReadWriteCloser by satisfying every listed shape. The helpers read and write over any reader or writer: ReadAll, ReadFull, ReadAtLeast, Copy, CopyN, CopyBuffer, LimitReader, TeeReader, MultiReader, MultiWriter, WriteString and Discard. A stream ends when Read returns 0 (flume's and ledger's readers do), not with a sentinel fault; ReadByte and ReadRune say the same with ok false and size 0.

Pipe connects a writer and a reader on different tasks or cores: it waits through the scheduler, never blocking a core, and holds back a writer while it is full. The byte, rune and string shapes (ByteReader, ByteScanner, RuneReader, RuneScanner, ByteWriter, StringWriter) and ReaderFrom and WriterTo are declared for code that wants them; a generic helper cannot ask a value which shapes it has, so Copy always copies through its buffer and a caller with a WriterTo calls WriteTo itself. The file system interface (Go's io/fs) is package fs. Reading, writing, closing and seeking change the stream, so those methods are mut (#644): a type's method may take its receiver mut, and a call through a dyn value needs a mut one (w mut dyn io.Writer).

- `shape Reader { mut Read(buf mut []u8) !i64 }`: Reader is anything with Read: it fills buf and returns how many bytes it wrote.
- `shape Writer { mut Write(data []u8) !i64 }`: Writer is anything with Write: it takes data and returns how many bytes it took.
- `shape Closer { mut Close() !i64 }`: Closer is anything with Close.
- `shape Seeker { mut Seek(offset i64, whence i64) !i64 }`: Seeker is anything with Seek: offset is relative to whence (0 start, 1 current, 2 end).
- `shape ReaderAt { ReadAt(buf mut []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: ReaderAt is a reader that does not move a position: it reads at off.
- `shape WriterAt { mut WriteAt(data []u8, off i64) !i64 }`: WriterAt is a writer that does not move a position: it writes at off.
- `shape ReadWriter`: ReadWriter reads and writes.
- `shape ReadCloser`: ReadCloser reads and closes.
- `shape WriteCloser`: WriteCloser writes and closes.
- `shape WriteSeeker`: WriteSeeker writes and seeks.
- `shape ReadSeekCloser`: ReadSeekCloser reads, seeks and closes.
- `shape ReadWriteCloser`: ReadWriteCloser reads, writes and closes.
- `shape ReadSeeker`: ReadSeeker reads and seeks.
- `shape ReadWriteSeeker`: ReadWriteSeeker reads, writes and seeks.
- `shape ByteReader { mut ReadByte() !(u8, bool) }`: ByteReader reads one byte at a time: ok is false at the end of the stream.
- `shape ByteScanner`: ByteScanner is a ByteReader that can step back: UnreadByte makes the next ReadByte return the byte the last one returned.
- `shape ByteWriter { mut WriteByte(c u8) ! }`: ByteWriter writes one byte.
- `shape RuneReader { mut ReadRune() !(i32, i64) }`: RuneReader reads one UTF-8 encoded rune: its value and its size in bytes, size 0 at the end of the stream (an invalid encoding is U+FFFD of size 1, as Go's readers give).
- `shape RuneScanner`: RuneScanner is a RuneReader that can step back: UnreadRune makes the next ReadRune return the rune the last one returned.
- `shape StringWriter { mut WriteString(s str) !i64 }`: StringWriter writes a str without making a []u8 of it, and returns how many bytes it took.
- `shape ReaderFrom { mut ReadFrom(src mut dyn Reader) !i64 }`: ReaderFrom reads src until its end into itself and returns how many bytes it took.
- `shape WriterTo { mut WriteTo(dst mut dyn Writer) !i64 }`: WriterTo writes its data to dst until it has none left and returns how many bytes it wrote.
- `ReadAll[R Reader](src R) !str`: ReadAll reads until the stream ends and returns what it read.
- `ReadFull[R Reader](src R, buf mut []u8) !i64`: ReadFull reads exactly len(buf) bytes; a stream that ends first fails with "unexpected end of stream". A zero-length buffer reads nothing.
- `ReadAtLeast[R Reader](src R, buf mut []u8, min i64) !i64`: ReadAtLeast reads at least min bytes (or until the stream ends) into buf; fewer than min bytes is the "unexpected end of stream" fault.
- `Copy[W Writer, R Reader](dst W, src R) !i64`: Copy reads from src and writes every chunk to dst until the stream ends, and returns how many bytes it copied. The scratch buffer is 32 KiB, as Go's is, taken from this core's pool of them and given back when Copy returns, so a loop of copies allocates nothing; a Reader must not keep the buffer it is given (Go's rule too).
- `CopyBuffer[W Writer, R Reader](dst W, src R, buf mut []u8) !i64`: CopyBuffer is Copy with the caller's scratch buffer, which must not be empty.
- `CopyN[W Writer, R Reader](dst W, src R, n i64) !i64`: CopyN copies exactly n bytes; fewer means the stream ended first, which is the "unexpected end of stream" fault.
- `WriteString[W Writer](dst W, s str) !i64`: WriteString writes s to dst.
- `type LimitedReader[R Reader] struct`: LimitedReader reads at most n bytes from r; it is what LimitReader returns.
- `LimitReader[R Reader](src R, n i64) LimitedReader[R]`: LimitReader returns a reader that yields at most n bytes of src and then ends.
- `(l LimitedReader[R]) Left() i64`: Left returns how many bytes the limit has left.
- `(l mut LimitedReader[R]) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads at most what the limit has left; it returns 0 once the limit is reached.
- `type TeeReader[R Reader, W Writer] struct`: TeeReader reads from r and writes what it read to w, like Go's TeeReader.
- `NewTeeReader[R Reader, W Writer](src R, dst W) TeeReader[R, W]`: NewTeeReader returns a reader that writes everything it reads from src to dst.
- `(t mut TeeReader[R, W]) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads from the underlying reader and writes the same bytes to the tee.
- `type MultiReader struct`: MultiReader reads several readers in turn, as one stream; it is what NewMultiReader returns and takes dyn values, so the readers may have different types.
- `NewMultiReader(rs []dyn Reader) MultiReader`: NewMultiReader reads the readers in order.
- `(m mut MultiReader) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads from the current reader; when one ends, the next is used, and the last one's end is the stream's end.
- `type MultiWriter struct`: MultiWriter writes to every writer in turn; it is what NewMultiWriter returns and takes dyn values, so the writers may have different types.
- `NewMultiWriter(ws []dyn Writer) MultiWriter`: NewMultiWriter writes each chunk to every writer, and fails when one takes less than all of it.
- `(m mut MultiWriter) Write(data []u8) !i64`: Write writes data to every writer.
- `type DiscardWriter struct{}`: DiscardWriter is a writer that throws everything away, like Go's io.Discard.
- `Discard() DiscardWriter`: Discard returns the writer that throws everything away.
- `(d mut DiscardWriter) Write(data []u8) !i64`: Write takes data and reports all of it written.
- `type PipeReader struct`: PipeReader is the read end of a Pipe: an io.Reader whose stream ends when the writer closes.
- `type PipeWriter struct`: PipeWriter is the write end of a Pipe: an io.Writer that waits while the pipe is full.
- `Pipe() !(PipeReader, PipeWriter)`: Pipe makes a pipe: what is written to the PipeWriter is read from the PipeReader, in order. Unlike Go's, which hands each Write to a Read, the pipe holds what the system's pipe buffer holds (64 KiB on Linux): a Write returns once its bytes are in the pipe, and waits while it is full, so a writer is held back by a slow reader. Close the writer to end the reader's stream; close both ends to give back the descriptors. Making a pipe ignores SIGPIPE in the process (as Go's runtime does for every descriptor but the standard ones), so a write to a pipe whose reader closed fails instead of ending the program.
- `(p PipeReader) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads what the writer wrote into buf, waiting until some is there, and returns how many bytes came: 0 once the writer closed and everything was read. A writer's CloseWithError makes the end of the stream that fault (its text) instead; a Read after this end's Close fails with ErrClosedPipe.
- `(p mut PipeReader) Close() !`: Close closes the read end: the writer's next Write fails with ErrClosedPipe. A second Close does nothing.
- `(p mut PipeReader) CloseWithError(err fault) !`: CloseWithError closes the read end; the writer's next Write fails with err's text (ErrClosedPipe for nil). Only the first close of an end counts.
- `(p PipeWriter) Write(data []u8) !i64`: Write writes all of data to the pipe, waiting while it is full, and returns len(data). Once the reader has closed it fails with ErrClosedPipe (or the reader's CloseWithError text) and the count of bytes that went in is lost with the fault, as a short write is; after this end's own Close it fails with ErrClosedPipe.
- `(p PipeWriter) WriteString(s str) !i64`: WriteString writes s to the pipe, as Write does.
- `(p mut PipeWriter) Close() !`: Close closes the write end: the reader reads what is left and then its stream ends (Read returns 0). A second Close does nothing.
- `(p mut PipeWriter) CloseWithError(err fault) !`: CloseWithError closes the write end; once the reader has read what is left, its Read fails with err's text instead of returning 0 (nil: the plain end). Only the first close counts.

## fs

Package fs is the file system interface, like Go's io/fs: a file system is anything with Open (the FS shape), and ReadDirFS, StatFS and SubFS add what WalkDir, Glob and Sub use. Names are slash-separated and unrooted ("a/b.txt", "." for the root; ValidPath says which are). ReadFile, ReadDir, Stat, Sub, Glob and WalkDir work over any file system with the shape they need; Dir is the operating system's file tree under a directory (Go's os.DirFS), read through quarry.

Where Go asks an interface at run time (fs.ReadDir tries ReadDirFS, then a file's ReadDir), a helper here names the shape it needs at compile time: WalkDir and Glob take a TreeFS (ReadDir and Stat). A File has Stat and ReadDir itself (ReadDir fails on a file that is not a directory). Faults are Go's PathError text ("open a/b: no such file or directory") and match ErrNotExist, ErrPermission, ErrExist and ErrInvalid with fault.Is as Go's errors.Is does. A directory listing ends with an empty slice, not a sentinel fault, as a Read ends with 0.

- `const ModeDir = 1 << 31`: ModeDir is the mode bit of a directory (Go's fs.ModeDir); modes are i64 values of Go's FileMode bits.
- `const ModeAppend = 1 << 30`: ModeAppend is the append-only bit.
- `const ModeExclusive = 1 << 29`: ModeExclusive is the exclusive-use bit.
- `const ModeTemporary = 1 << 28`: ModeTemporary is the temporary-file bit.
- `const ModeSymlink = 1 << 27`: ModeSymlink is the mode bit of a symbolic link.
- `const ModeDevice = 1 << 26`: ModeDevice is the mode bit of a device file.
- `const ModeNamedPipe = 1 << 25`: ModeNamedPipe is the mode bit of a FIFO.
- `const ModeSocket = 1 << 24`: ModeSocket is the mode bit of a Unix domain socket.
- `const ModeSetuid = 1 << 23`: ModeSetuid is the setuid bit.
- `const ModeSetgid = 1 << 22`: ModeSetgid is the setgid bit.
- `const ModeCharDevice = 1 << 21`: ModeCharDevice is the bit of a character device (set with ModeDevice).
- `const ModeSticky = 1 << 20`: ModeSticky is the sticky bit.
- `const ModeIrregular = 1 << 19`: ModeIrregular is the bit of a file of no other known type.
- `const ModeType = ModeDir | ModeSymlink | ModeNamedPipe | ModeSocket | ModeDevice | ModeCharDevice | ModeIrregular`: ModeType is the type bits: a mode with none of them is a regular file.
- `const ModePerm = 0o777`: ModePerm is the Unix permission bits.
- `type FileInfo struct`: FileInfo describes a file, as Stat reports it (Go's fs.FileInfo).
- `(i FileInfo) IsDir() bool`: IsDir reports whether the file is a directory.
- `(i FileInfo) Type() i64`: Type is the file's type bits (Mode & ModeType).
- `type DirEntry struct`: DirEntry is a name in a directory with its type bits (Go's fs.DirEntry); fs.Stat gives the rest.
- `(d DirEntry) IsDir() bool`: IsDir reports whether the entry is a directory.
- `FileInfoToDirEntry(info FileInfo) DirEntry`: FileInfoToDirEntry is the DirEntry of a file described by info.
- `shape File`: File is an open file: Read until it returns 0, Stat, ReadDir for a directory, and Close. ReadDir(n) with n > 0 gives at most n entries and an empty slice at the end; n <= 0 gives all that are left.
- `type FileReader struct`: FileReader is an open File as an io.Reader, what Reader returns: a dyn File satisfies only its own shape (dyn-to-dyn widening, E514, is not built), so io.Copy and io.ReadAll take this.
- `Reader(f dyn File) FileReader`: Reader is f as an io.Reader: its Read is f's.
- `(r mut FileReader) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads from the file.
- `shape FS`: FS is a file system: Open opens a file by a name ValidPath accepts.
- `shape ReadDirFS`: ReadDirFS is a file system that lists a directory by name, sorted by name.
- `shape StatFS`: StatFS is a file system that describes a file by name.
- `shape ReadFileFS`: ReadFileFS is a file system that reads a whole file by name.
- `shape TreeFS`: TreeFS lists directories and describes files: what WalkDir and Glob need.
- `shape SubFS[S constraints.Any]`: SubFS is a file system whose Sub gives the file system of one of its directories, of type S.
- `ValidPath(name str) bool`: ValidPath reports whether name is a valid file system name: UTF-8, slash-separated elements that are not empty, "." or "..", no leading or trailing slash; "." alone names the root.
- `PathError(op str, path str, err fault) !`: PathError is err with the operation and the name in front ("op path: err"), as Go's fs.PathError prints; err stays reachable with fault.Is.
- `ReadFile[F FS](fsys F, name str) !str`: ReadFile reads the named file to its end: Open, Read until 0, Close.
- `ReadDir[F ReadDirFS](fsys F, name str) ![]DirEntry`: ReadDir lists the named directory, sorted by name.
- `Stat[F StatFS](fsys F, name str) !FileInfo`: Stat describes the named file.
- `Glob[F TreeFS](fsys F, pattern str) ![]str`: Glob lists the names that match pattern (trail.Match's syntax, per element), in lexical order within each directory, like Go's fs.Glob: a directory that cannot be read is skipped, a pattern with no special bytes gives itself when Stat finds it, and only a malformed pattern is a fault (ErrBadPattern).
- `WalkDir[F TreeFS](fsys F, root str, f fn(str, ?DirEntry, fault) !) !`: WalkDir calls f for root and every file and directory below it, in lexical order, like Go's fs.WalkDir: f gets the path (root joined with the names), the entry (nil when root cannot be described) and nil, or a fault: Stat's for root, or ReadDir's in a second call for a directory that cannot be listed. f's fault ends the walk and is WalkDir's, except SkipDir (skip this directory, or the rest of the one a file is in) and SkipAll (stop, with no fault). Symbolic links inside the tree are not followed; a root that is one is.
- `ModeString(m i64) str`: ModeString is a mode as Go's FileMode.String prints it: the type and special letters ("dalTLDpSugct?") or "-", then rwxrwxrwx with "-" for a missing permission.
- `type DirFS struct`: DirFS is the file tree under a directory of the operating system, read through quarry (Go's os.DirFS): it is a TreeFS, a ReadFileFS and a SubFS[DirFS]. Names are joined to the root with a slash; a name ValidPath refuses fails with ErrInvalid, and the faults name the name, not the joined path, as Go's do.
- `Dir(root str) DirFS`: Dir is the file tree under root.
- `(d DirFS) Root() str`: Root is the directory the file system was made with.
- `(d DirFS) Open(name str) !dyn File`: Open opens the named file or directory for reading.
- `(d DirFS) Stat(name str) !FileInfo`: Stat describes the named file, following a symbolic link.
- `(d DirFS) Lstat(name str) !FileInfo`: Lstat describes the named file; a symbolic link is described itself.
- `(d DirFS) ReadDir(name str) ![]DirEntry`: ReadDir lists the named directory, sorted by name, with each entry's type (not following links).
- `(d DirFS) ReadFile(name str) !str`: ReadFile reads the whole named file with quarry.ReadFile (its 64 MiB bound and its waits in a task).
- `(d DirFS) Sub(dir str) !DirFS`: Sub is the file tree under the directory dir of this one.
- `(f mut osFile) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads the next bytes of the file into buf: 0 at the end. A directory cannot be read.
- `(f osFile) Stat() !FileInfo`: Stat describes the file as it was when it was opened.
- `(f mut osFile) ReadDir(n i64) ![]DirEntry`: ReadDir gives the directory's next n entries (all that are left for n <= 0), sorted by name; an empty slice at the end.
- `(f mut osFile) Close() !`: Close closes the file; a second Close fails with ErrClosed.

## anvil

Package anvil is an HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 server: one event loop per core (epoll, kqueue), share-nothing. HTTP/2 without TLS (h2c) is served on the same port, by prior knowledge or after Upgrade: h2c, and over TLS (ServeTLS) to a client whose ALPN offers h2; handlers are the same for both, each request (or stream) in a task of its own.

Core 0 accepts connections and deals them round-robin to every core through a pipe; from then on a connection belongs to one core for its whole life. Each core reads into one scratch buffer, parses requests in place, runs the handler, writes every response of the batch with one write, and wipes its request pool. Idle connections hold no buffers, only a 96-byte record.

```tin
type Msg struct {
	message str
}

fn handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	w.Type("application/json")
	argo.Put(mut w.Body, Msg{message: "hi"})
}

fn main() {
	anvil.Serve(":8080", handle) catch err {
		say.Line("server:", err)
	}
}
```

A Router picks the handler by method and path pattern, and runs middleware around it. Patterns match whole segments: "users" itself, {id} any one non-empty segment, and a last {path...} or * the rest of the path. Static segments win over {name}, and {name} over the rest, segment by segment, whatever the order of registration. A path whose routes take other methods gets 405 with Allow, any other miss 404; HEAD falls back to GET. A trailing slash is part of the path: /users/ and /users are different routes. Write patterns with {...} as raw strings: in "..." the braces would interpolate.

```tin
fn user(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	let id = q.PathParam("id")
	w.Text("user {id}")
}

fn logged(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out, next fn(anvil.Req, mut anvil.Out)) {
	next(q, mut w)
	herald.Log(herald.LInfo, "request", []str{
		"method", q.Method, "route", q.Pattern(), "status", say.Str(w.Code()), "client", q.ClientIP(),
	})
}

fn main() {
	let r = anvil.NewRouter()
	r.Use(logged)
	r.Get(`/users/{id}`, user)
	r.Route("/admin", fn(g mut anvil.Router) {
		g.Use(logged)
		g.Delete(`/users/{id}`, user)
	})
	r.Serve(":8080") catch err {
		say.Line("server:", err)
	}
}
```

The middleware writes one herald line per request, with the client's address as client:

```text
2026-10-05T09:00:00.000Z INFO core=0 request method=GET route=/users/{id} status=200 client=203.0.113.7
```

q.ClientIP() is the connection's peer unless the peer is one of the TrustedProxies: behind a proxy of yours, call TrustedProxies first, or every line carries the proxy's address.

ServeTLS (and Router.ServeTLS) serve HTTPS: TLS 1.3 with a PEM certificate chain and key, each handshake in a task of its own, then the same event loop with records decrypted before parsing and sealed before writing (toolchain/docs/RUNTIME.md). examples/https_server.tin.

- `TrustedProxies(cidrs []str) !`: TrustedProxies sets the proxies whose X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded headers ClientIP believes, as networks ("10.0.0.0/8", "fd00::/8") or single addresses. Call it before Serve. With none (the default) ClientIP is the connection's peer: the headers are written by the client and prove nothing unless a proxy you run replaced them.
- `(q Req) RemoteAddr() str`: RemoteAddr is the address the request's connection comes from, "ip:port" ("[ip]:port" for IPv6, and an IPv4 client of an IPv6 listener as IPv4), or "" for a request made in the process. It is read once per connection. A request replayed from a capsule (#242) gets the address it was recorded with, "" when the capsule is older than that (schema 1).
- `(q Req) ClientIP() str`: ClientIP is the client's IP address: the connection's peer, or, when the peer is one of the TrustedProxies, the rightmost address of X-Forwarded-For (else Forwarded's for=) that is not a trusted proxy. A malformed entry ends the walk at the peer. "" for a request made in the process.
- `type Req struct`: Req is the request being served. Its strings live in the request pool: keep() them to store them anywhere long-lived.
- `type Out struct`: Out is the response being built. Body is the response body; the status defaults to 200 and the content type to text/plain.
- `Serve(addr str, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: Serve listens on addr (":8080", "127.0.0.1:8080") and serves h on every core. It returns only if the server cannot start. TIN_CORES overrides the number of cores (1 to 1024; another value is named on stderr and the CPU count is used).
- `ServeN(addr str, n i64, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `Drain(grace i64)`: Drain starts the graceful shutdown from code, as SIGTERM does (#238): listeners close, the requests in flight finish, and after grace nanoseconds what is left is cancelled with fault.Draining; then the cores stop, Serve returns and the stop events run. Any core may call it; it does nothing outside a server or once a shutdown started.
- `Timeouts(header i64, read i64, idle i64, write i64)`: Timeouts sets the connection timeouts in milliseconds; 0 turns one off. header: a request's line and headers must arrive within it (slowloris); read: the whole request, body included; idle: a keep-alive connection with no request in progress; write: a response the client stops reading (no progress for this long). A connection is closed when one passes; a request whose handler is running is governed by Deadline instead. Defaults 10000, 60000, 60000 and 30000; TIN_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_READ_TIMEOUT_MS, TIN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS and TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS override them. Call before Serve.
- `type Load struct`: Load is what an admission policy sees of the core a new request arrived on: its waiting request tasks, live connections, bytes buffered for requests still arriving, how many requests were refused so far, the request-pool bytes its requests hold beyond each one's first chunk (what TIN_REQUEST_MEMORY counts), and the bytes its long-lived (ingot) heap holds (design_semantics §11).
- `Admit(p fn(Load) bool)`: Admit sets the admission policy (call before Serve): after the built-in limits, p decides each new request before its handler runs; false answers 503 with Retry-After: 1 without running the handler. Every core calls p with its own Load.
- `Limits(maxBody i64, maxBuffered i64, maxConns i64)`: Limits sets the largest request body in bytes (413 past it), the bytes of requests still arriving that one core may buffer (a new partial request past it gets 503 and close), and the connections per core (0: no limit). Past maxConns a core still accepts up to 64 more connections and answers each request on them 503 with Retry-After and Connection: close, so a load balancer reads an answer instead of a reset; only past that margin is a new connection closed at accept. Defaults 64 MiB, 256 MiB and 16384; TIN_MAX_BODY, TIN_MAX_BUFFERED and TIN_MAX_CONNS override them. Call before Serve.
- `Deadline(ms i64)`: Deadline makes every request's waits (tide.Wait, client calls) fail with "deadline exceeded" once ms have passed since the request started (0: no deadline; call before Serve). TIN_DEADLINE_MS sets it too; the default is 30000.
- `(q Req) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the value of the request header name (any case), or "". A chunked request's trailer fields are read after the header block's, whether or not a Trailer field announced them: a field of the header block wins, and the framing fields (Host, Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding) are never taken from trailers. Go keeps trailers apart, in Request.Trailer. For an absolute-form target ("GET http://host/path", as proxies send), "host" is the target's authority, which replaces the Host field (RFC 9112 3.2.2, #749).
- `(q Req) Proto() str`: Proto is the protocol the request came in: "HTTP/2.0" (h2c, or h2 over TLS), "HTTP/1.1" or "HTTP/1.0". A request made with Router.Run is "HTTP/1.1".
- `(q Req) Hijack() !i64`: Hijack takes the request's connection out of HTTP for a protocol of its own (the websocket package uses it): the responses before this request are written, the core stops reading the connection and the request's deadline no longer applies. It returns the non-blocking descriptor, for the caller's I/O until the handler returns; then anvil closes it. The handler's Out is not sent. An HTTP/2 stream cannot be hijacked: Hijack fails there.
- `(w mut Out) Stream() !`: Stream switches the response to streaming. The status, content type and headers set so far are sent with the first Write or Flush (set them before). The body is then written with Write and Flush, in chunks (Transfer-Encoding: chunked), or as a plain body of the size Length gave; an HTTP/1.0 client, which cannot read chunks, gets the body up to the end of the connection. Each write waits for a slow client within the write timeout (TIN_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS), and the request deadline (TIN_DEADLINE_MS) counts from the last write, so a stream lives as long as it keeps writing. Calling Stream again does nothing. On HTTP/2 the body goes in DATA frames within the client's flow-control windows, and Length sets content-length.
- `(w mut Out) Length(n i64) !`: Length sets the size of the streamed body in bytes: the response then has a Content-Length header instead of chunks, and the handler must write exactly n bytes. Call it after Stream and before the first Write or Flush.
- `(w mut Out) Write(b []u8) !`: Write sends b as part of the body, after the head if that is not out yet. It waits while the client does not read, and fails when the client has closed the connection, stopped reading for the write timeout, or the request was cancelled: the handler should stop then. Text appended to the body with Text or argo.Put(mut w.Body, v) is sent by the next Write or Flush.
- `(w mut Out) WriteString(s str) !`: WriteString is Write for a str.
- `(w mut Out) Flush() !`: Flush sends the head if it is not out yet and what Text or argo.Put put in the body so far, as one chunk: with it a handler makes a client see an event now.
- `(w mut Out) Abort()`: Abort ends a stream the handler cannot finish (its data source failed halfway): the connection closes without the last chunk, so the client sees an incomplete response instead of a short one that looks complete. Before the head is sent, the response is an ordinary one again.
- `(w Out) Closed() bool`: Closed reports whether the client has closed the connection (a stream's handler asks between events: a write only fails once the client's reset arrives).
- `(w mut Out) SendFile(path str, off i64, n i64) !`: SendFile sends n bytes of the file at path, from byte off, as the body (n < 0: to the end of the file). As the whole body of a response that is not streaming yet it starts the stream with a Content-Length of n, so a download is `w.SendFile(path, 0, -1)`; in a stream already begun, the bytes go out as chunks or as part of the Content-Length body. The file goes to the socket with sendfile(2) in pieces of 1 MiB on a helper thread, so it is never read into the request pool and a slow disk does not stop the core; each piece waits for a slow client within the write timeout. The file is opened and its size read as quarry.OpenRegular does, through the core's io_uring or on a helper thread within the request's deadline, never on the core thread (#744); a directory or anything else that is not a regular file fails before the head is sent, so the handler can still answer.
- `(q Req) Body() str`: Body returns the request body (a chunked one decoded).
- `(q Req) BodyBound(n i64) !str`: BodyBound returns the request body when it is at most n bytes, and otherwise fails with fault.LimitExceeded before copying any of it: the compiler calls it for q.Body() into a bounded type (try bound(q.Body()), #240).
- `(q Req) Param(name str) str`: Param returns query parameter name, %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) PathParam(name str) str`: PathParam returns path parameter name of the Router route that matched ({name}, {name...}, or "*" for a last *), %-decoded, or "".
- `(q Req) Pattern() str`: Pattern returns the pattern of the Router route serving the request ("/users/{id}"), or "" (no Router, or a 404 or 405 answer).
- `(w mut Out) Status(code i64)`: Status sets the response status code.
- `(w mut Out) Type(t str)`: Type sets the Content-Type header. Control bytes in t (CR, LF, NUL and the others but HTAB, and DEL) become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines.
- `(w mut Out) Head(k str, v str)`: Head adds a response header. A name that is not an HTTP token is ignored, and so are Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding and Connection: anvil writes the framing itself. Control bytes in the value (CR, LF, NUL and the others but HTAB, and DEL) become spaces, so a value taken from the request cannot add header lines or a body (response splitting), as Go's net/http does, nor hand a client a value RFC 9110 5.5 forbids (#748).
- `(w mut Out) Trailer(k str, v str)`: Trailer adds a trailer field, sent after the body: on HTTP/2 in a HEADERS frame that ends the stream (gRPC's grpc-status and grpc-message), on HTTP/1.1 after the last chunk of a chunked stream (w.Stream() without Length). A response with a Content-Length cannot carry trailers in HTTP/1.1: they are dropped there. Like Head, a name that is not a token and the framing fields are ignored, and control bytes in the value become spaces.
- `(w mut Out) Text(s str)`: Text appends s to the body.
- `(w mut Out) Json()`: Json sets the JSON content type; the body is then written with argo.Put(mut w.Body, v).
- `(w Out) Code() i64`: Code returns the response status set so far (200 unless Status changed it).
- `(w Out) Header(k str) str`: Header returns response header k as set so far (Type sets Content-Type, Head the rest), or "".
- `(w mut Out) SetValue(key str, value str)`: SetValue stores value under key for the rest of the request: middleware hand data (a user id, a request id) to the handlers after them this way. Value reads it back.
- `(w Out) Value(key str) str`: Value returns what SetValue stored under key in this request, or "".
- `OnRelay(h fn(i64, str))`: OnRelay makes every core run h(from, msg) for each relay message it receives (call before Serve). Handlers run between requests, with their own request pool.
- `OnTick(ms i64, h fn(i64))`: OnTick makes every core run h(core) every ms milliseconds (call before Serve).
- `type Router struct`: Router sends each request to the handler routed for its method and path pattern, through the middleware added with Use. Build it in main (or in a function a global's initializer calls), then Serve it, or try requests on it with Run.
- `NewRouter() Router`: NewRouter makes an empty router: every request gets 404 until routes are added.
- `(r mut Router) Get(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Get routes GET requests for pattern to h, and HEAD requests unless Head routes them.
- `(r mut Router) Post(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Post routes POST requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Put(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Put routes PUT requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Patch(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Patch routes PATCH requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Delete(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Delete routes DELETE requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Head(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Head routes HEAD requests for pattern to h (without it, they go to the GET route).
- `(r mut Router) Options(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Options routes OPTIONS requests for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Handle(method str, pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Handle routes requests with method (any HTTP method name, like "PROPFIND") for pattern to h.
- `(r mut Router) Stream(method str, pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Stream routes method requests for pattern to h, which runs as soon as the request's headers are in and reads the body as it arrives with q.BodyStream() (#481): large uploads in bounded memory, gRPC client and bidirectional streams. TIN_MAX_BODY does not bound such a body.
- `(r mut Router) Any(pattern str, h fn(Req, mut Out))`: Any routes requests for pattern with every method to h; a route for the request's own method on the same pattern wins over it.
- `(r mut Router) Use(mw fn(Req, mut Out, fn(Req, mut Out)))`: Use adds middleware mw to r. Middleware run in the order added, around every route of r and of the routers mounted in it, and around their 404 and 405 answers. Each gets next, the rest of the chain, and decides whether and when to call it.
- `(r mut Router) Route(prefix str, build fn(mut Router))`: Route groups routes under prefix ("/api"): build adds them to a new router mounted there.
- `(r mut Router) Mount(prefix str, sub Router)`: Mount serves sub's routes under prefix: "/api" and "/users" make "/api/users", and "/api" and "" make "/api". r's middleware run before sub's, and sub's 404 and 405 answers (with its middleware) cover the paths under prefix.
- `(r mut Router) NotFound(h fn(Req, mut Out))`: NotFound sets the handler for the paths no route matches (under r's prefix when r is mounted); the status starts as 404.
- `(r mut Router) MethodNotAllowed(h fn(Req, mut Out))`: MethodNotAllowed sets the handler for the paths whose routes take other methods; the status starts as 405 and the Allow header lists those methods.
- `(r Router) Check() !`: Check fails with r's first bad pattern, conflicting route or misplaced mount, the error Serve would fail with before listening.
- `(r Router) Serve(addr str) !`: Serve listens on addr and serves r on every core, like anvil.Serve. The routes are checked and compiled once, into a table every core reads; Serve fails with r's error, if any (see Check).
- `(r Router) ServeN(addr str, n i64) !`: ServeN is Serve on exactly n cores.
- `(r Router) Run(method str, target str, body str) Out`: Run sends one request through r on this thread, as Serve would (middleware, 404, 405), and returns the response: for tests. target is the path and query ("/users/7?full=1"), the request has no headers, and a HEAD response keeps its body. Run panics if r has an error (see Check).
- `(r Router) RunWith(method str, target str, headers []str, body str) Out`: RunWith is Run with request header fields, each written "Name: value" (Cookie, Content-Type ...): for tests of handlers that read headers, cookies or forms.
- `(r Router) Match(method str, path str) str`: Match returns the pattern of the route that would serve method and path ("/users/{id}"), or "" when the request would get 404 or 405. Like Run, it panics if r has an error (see Check).
- `type Cookie struct`: Cookie is a Set-Cookie: the name, the value and the attributes. Expires is in Unix seconds and left out when 0; MaxAge in seconds is left out when 0 and, when negative, is written as Max-Age=0 (delete the cookie). SameSite is "", "Lax", "Strict" or "None".
- `(q Req) Cookie(name str) str`: Cookie returns the value of the request's cookie name, or "" when there is none (or it is not well formed): see Cookies.
- `(q Req) Cookies() map[str]str`: Cookies returns the request's cookies by name, as Go's Request.Cookies does: every Cookie header field is read (HTTP/2 joins its cookie fields with "; "), a pair splits at its first "=", a value may be wrapped in double quotes, and a pair with a bad name or value is skipped. When a name occurs twice, the first value wins.
- `(w mut Out) SetCookie(c Cookie)`: SetCookie adds a Set-Cookie header for c. A cookie whose name is not a token is dropped, a Domain that is not a valid domain name or IPv4 address is left out, and bytes that cannot be in the value or the path are removed, as Go's http.SetCookie does. Each call adds a header field of its own, so several cookies can be set in one response (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2).
- `(c Cookie) String() str`: String is the Set-Cookie header value for c, or "" when its name is not a valid cookie name.
- `(w Out) Headers(k str) []str`: Headers returns the values of every response header field called k as set so far (Head adds one per call), in order: all the Set-Cookie fields of a response, for tests.
- `(w mut Out) ServeFile(q Req, path str) !`: ServeFile sends the file at path as the response to request q. It sets Content-Type (from the extension, unless the handler set Type), Accept-Ranges, Last-Modified (the file's modification time) and ETag (the handler's own, if it set one, else a strong tag made of the time and the size), then decides as http.ServeContent does:  - If-Match that matches no tag, or If-Unmodified-Since before the file's time: 412 Precondition Failed; - If-None-Match that matches (a weak comparison), or, without it, If-Modified-Since at or after the file's time: 304 Not Modified for GET and HEAD (412 for other methods), with no body; - Range: bytes=a-b, a- or -n (when If-Range, if given, matches the tag or the time): 206 Partial Content with Content-Range, or 416 Range Not Satisfiable (with Content-Range: bytes */size) when the range starts past the end or is malformed. Several ranges in one request are answered with the whole file, which RFC 9110 allows; - otherwise 200 with the file.  The file is opened as SendFile does, never on the core thread; a missing file, a directory or anything but a regular file fails before anything is sent, so the handler can answer 404.
- `(q Req) PostForm() !link.Values`: PostForm returns the fields of an application/x-www-form-urlencoded request body of a POST, PUT or PATCH request, and nothing for any other request. A body over 10 MiB fails with fault.LimitExceeded, and a malformed field (a bad escape, a semicolon) fails with the first error. Use Multipart for multipart/form-data.
- `(q Req) Form() !link.Values`: Form returns the form fields of the request: those of a urlencoded body first (see PostForm), then those of the URL query, as Go's Request.Form does.
- `(q Req) FormValue(key str) str`: FormValue returns the first value of form field key (see Form), or "" when there is none or the form is malformed.
- `(w mut Out) Redirect(url_in str, code i64)`: Redirect answers with status code (301, 302, 303, 307 or 308) and a Location header, as Go's http.Redirect does: a url without a scheme and host is made absolute against the request's path (relative ones are resolved here, "." and ".." removed, the query kept), bytes outside ASCII are percent-encoded, a GET gets a small HTML body with a link, and a HEAD or a POST none.
- `StuckCores() i64`: StuckCores is how many cores have not turned their event loop for 1.5 seconds: each is running something that does not wait (a handler stuck in a loop, say). 0 while no server runs.
- `StuckFor() i64`: StuckFor is how long, in milliseconds, the most stuck core's event loop has not turned (0: every core turns). A service can export it and alert before a stuck core is an outage.
- `type MultipartReader struct`: MultipartReader reads the parts of a multipart body in order.
- `type Part struct`: Part is one part of a multipart body: its header fields and its content, which Read gives.
- `(q Req) Multipart() !MultipartReader`: Multipart returns a reader for the request's multipart/form-data body. It fails when the Content-Type is not multipart/form-data or has no boundary parameter.
- `NewMultipartReader(body str, boundary str) MultipartReader`: NewMultipartReader reads the multipart body in memory (for example a stored message) with the given boundary, as q.Multipart does a request's.
- `(m mut MultipartReader) SetBufferSize(n i64)`: SetBufferSize sets the size of the reader's read-ahead buffer (at least 128 bytes; the default is 64 KiB): a small buffer makes the body cross buffer boundaries often, which the tests use.
- `(m mut MultipartReader) SetLimit(n i64)`: SetLimit makes reading more than n body bytes fail with fault.LimitExceeded (the headers and the preamble count).
- `(m mut MultipartReader) NextPart() !?Part`: NextPart returns the next part, or nil when the body has no more. What is left of the previous part is skipped.
- `(p Part) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the value of the part's header field name (any case), the first when there are several, or "".
- `(p Part) Headers() []str`: Headers returns every header field of the part as "Name: value".
- `(p Part) FormName() str`: FormName returns the name parameter of the part's Content-Disposition when it is form-data, and "" otherwise.
- `(p Part) FileName() str`: FileName returns the filename parameter of the part's Content-Disposition without its directory (what follows the last "/"), or "".
- `(p mut Part) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads the part's content into buf and returns how many bytes it wrote, 0 at the end of the part. It fails when the body ends inside the part, when reading the body fails and when the reader's limit is passed.
- `(p mut Part) Bytes(max i64) !str`: Bytes reads the whole content of the part, failing with fault.LimitExceeded when it is longer than max bytes.
- `type FormFile struct`: FormFile is one uploaded file of a MultipartForm: the form field, the file's name as sent (without directories), its Content-Type and its bytes.
- `type MultipartForm struct`: MultipartForm is a whole multipart form read into memory.
- `(q Req) MultipartForm(max i64) !MultipartForm`: MultipartForm reads the whole multipart/form-data body into memory: the parts with a filename become Files, the others Values. It fails with fault.LimitExceeded when the body is longer than max bytes.
- `ServeTLS(addr str, certPEM str, keyPEM str, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeTLS is Serve over TLS 1.3 (HTTPS): certPEM is the certificate chain (leaf first) and keyPEM the leaf's private key (RSA, or ECDSA P-256 or P-384), as PEM text. The pair is checked before listening. ALPN offers "h2" (HTTP/2) and then "http/1.1"; a client without ALPN gets HTTP/1.1. Each handshake runs in a task, so slow clients never hold a core; it must finish within TIN_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS (default: the header timeout, 10 s). Clients without TLS 1.3 are refused with a protocol_version alert, and those whose ALPN offers neither protocol with no_application_protocol.
- `(r Router) ServeTLS(addr str, certPEM str, keyPEM str) !`: ServeTLS is Serve over TLS 1.3, as anvil.ServeTLS: the routes are checked first, then the certificate and key.
- `type TLSConfig struct`: TLSConfig configures ServeTLSConfig: the certificate chain and private key, as ServeTLS takes them, more certificates chosen by the client's server name (#476), and client certificates (mutual TLS, #475).
- `type TLSCert struct`: TLSCert is one certificate chain (leaf first) and its private key: PEM text, or the paths of PEM files, which the server reads again when they change (#476).
- `ReloadCertificates(certs []TLSCert) !`: ReloadCertificates replaces the server's certificates, from any core while it serves: the first is the default, the others are chosen by the client's server name. Every pair is checked first, and a bad one fails the call and changes nothing. Each core switches at its next handshake; connections already up keep their own. Pairs given as files are read now, and when the whole set was given as files, core 0 reads them again every TIN_TLS_RELOAD_S seconds (default 60) and reloads when they changed, so a renewal written to disk needs no call.
- `ServeTLSConfig(addr str, cfg TLSConfig, h fn(Req, mut Out)) !`: ServeTLSConfig is ServeTLS with a TLSConfig. With ClientAuth set, every full handshake asks for a client certificate: RequireClientCert refuses a client without one (certificate_required), and both refuse one that does not chain to ClientCAs for client authentication. A handler finds the verified chain in q.TLSConn().PeerCertificates().
- `(r Router) ServeTLSConfig(addr str, cfg TLSConfig) !`: ServeTLSConfig is Serve over TLS with a TLSConfig, as anvil.ServeTLSConfig.
- `(q Req) TLSConn() ?tls.Conn`: TLSConn is the TLS connection the request arrived on, or nil over plain TCP: for its ALPN(), CipherSuite() and Group(). After Hijack every byte must go through it (Read, Write, Close), since the descriptor carries records.
- `type BodyReader struct`: BodyReader reads a request body: Read fills buf with the next bytes. It is q.BodyStream().
- `(q Req) BodyStream() BodyReader`: BodyStream is the request body as a stream: on a route registered with Router.Stream it arrives as the handler reads it; elsewhere it has arrived whole (and Body has it too). Read the body either with Body or with BodyStream, not with both.
- `(r BodyReader) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read fills buf with the body's next bytes, waiting for them, and returns how many it wrote: 0 at the end of the body. It fails when the client ends the connection or resets the stream before the end of the body, when no byte comes within the read timeout, and at the request's deadline.

## hearth

Package hearth runs a program on every core: one thread per core, each with its own globals, request pool and ingot heap. Cores share nothing; relay carries messages.

- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of CPUs this program may use: the CPUs online, capped on Linux by the affinity mask (cpuset) and the cgroup CPU quota (ceil of cpu.max quota/period); never 0. It is how many cores to start (hearth.Run(hearth.Cores(), entry)), not how many run: relay.Cores() is the number started, and only those read their relay inbox.
- `MemLimit() i64`: MemLimit is the memory limit in bytes the container (cgroup) imposes: 0 when there is none.
- `ID() i64`: ID is the current core's number: 0 for the main core.
- `Run(n i64, entry fn(i64))`: Run starts entry(i) on cores 1..n-1, runs entry(0) here, then waits for every core. Before starting it sizes the request pools to the memory limit and decides whether cores pin themselves to CPUs (only when they map one-to-one onto the allowed CPUs, or TIN_PIN=1).
- `PoolChunk() i64`: PoolChunk is the request pool chunk size in bytes each core uses (after pool_tune).
- `PoolCapacity() i64`: PoolCapacity is the usable size in bytes of this core's current base pool chunk (0 before its first request allocation).
- `Reset()`: Reset ends the current request: the core's pool is emptied for the next one.
- `HeapStats() (i64, i64, i64)`: HeapStats reports what this core's long-lived heap has from the system (#345): the bytes of its slabs (blocks up to 256 KiB), the bytes of the mappings of its larger blocks (those in use and those kept for reuse) and the number of mappings in all.
- `Quiet(wait fn())`: Quiet runs wait (a tide.Wait, a receive from a channel) with the calling task taken out of the runtime's reclamation epochs (#358). A task that lives for hours, such as a detach loop, holds back the release of every long-lived value dropped on its core while it lives, and past a million waiting blocks the core stops releasing them (RcStats shows the limbo). A task that waits inside Quiet holds back nothing, on the condition that it holds no value it borrowed from long-lived memory across the call: `let u = cache[k]` before Quiet is not safe to use after it, so read it again. websocket.Conn's reads work this way.
- `RcStats() (i64, i64, i64)`: RcStats reports what long-lived memory this core still counts (#176): the number of counted blocks, their bytes and how many dropped blocks wait in the limbo.

## relay

Package relay carries messages between cores, which share no memory. A message is a str copied into the receiving core's inbox (a lock-free multi-producer queue); the receiver gets its own copy in its request pool. Encode structs with argo.Put/argo.Get. Send only to cores below relay.Cores(), the cores the program started: hearth.Cores() is the CPUs it may use, and a message to a core that was never started waits forever.

```tin body
relay.Send(2, "hello")              // from any core
let (from, msg) = relay.Recv()      // on core 2: blocks until a message arrives
let (src, text) = try relay.Next()  // the same, but fails on a deadline or cancel
```

- `Send(to i64, msg str)`: Send copies msg into core to's inbox; it never blocks. A core that was never started (to >= Cores()) never reads it.
- `Broadcast(msg str)`: Broadcast sends msg to every other running core.
- `Cores() i64`: Cores is the number of cores the program started (1 before hearth.Run), the cores whose inboxes are read. hearth.Cores() is a different number: the CPUs the program may use.
- `TryRecv() (i64, str, bool)`: TryRecv returns the next message for this core, if there is one.
- `Recv() (i64, str)`: Recv blocks until a message for this core arrives and returns its sender and text. It blocks the whole core and ignores deadlines and cancels; use Next in tasks and within blocks.
- `Next() !(i64, str)`: Next waits until a message for this core arrives and returns its sender and text. Unlike Recv it waits through rt_task_wait: inside a task the core serves other tasks meanwhile, and a deadline (within, the request's) or a cancel ends the wait with that fault. Under anvil.OnRelay the event loop takes every message, so do not call Next there.
- `WakeFD() i64`: WakeFD is this core's wake-up descriptor, for event loops: after it turns readable, call Drain. Arm must be called before the loop blocks.
- `Arm()`: Arm asks senders to wake this core through WakeFD (call just before blocking).
- `Drain(h fn(i64, str))`: Drain runs h on every waiting message (event loops call it after WakeFD fires).
- `Received() i64`: Received is how many messages this core has taken from its inbox.
- `Me() i64`: Me is this core's number.

## task

Package task reads the deadline and cancellation of the running code, which belong to its innermost boundary (the request, a `within` or `limit` block, a scope's child; Go's context.Context Deadline and Err, without passing a context). Waits already fail when either stops the code: these are for code that does not wait, or that wants to stop at a point of its own choosing.

- `Deadline() i64`: Deadline is the effective deadline of the running code in tide.Now() nanoseconds (the earliest of its request's and every enclosing within block's), or 0 when it has none.
- `Canceled() !`: Canceled is nil while the running code may go on, else the fault its next wait would fail with: fault.DeadlineExceeded once the deadline has passed, fault.LimitExceeded past a budget, or fault.Canceled wrapping the reason of a cancel or drain.

## wire

Package wire is TCP networking and an HTTP client: HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 to servers that choose it by ALPN or with Options.H2C (#480). Calls inside a request wait without blocking the core; every connection can carry a read/write timeout.

```tin body
let c = try wire.Dial("127.0.0.1:6379")
try c.Write("PING\r\n")
let r = try wire.Get("http://127.0.0.1:8080/json")
```

- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a TCP connection.
- `type Listener struct`: Listener accepts TCP connections.
- `type Resp struct`: Resp is an HTTP response.
- `IsEOF(err fault) bool`: EOF is the fault Read returns at the end of the stream.
- `Dial(addr str) !Conn`: Dial connects to "host:port".
- `DialTimeout(addr str, timeout i64) !Conn`: DialTimeout connects to "host:port", giving up after timeout nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) Fd() i64`: Fd is the connection's descriptor, for clients that do their own I/O on it (it stays non-blocking; Close still closes it).
- `(c mut Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetNoDelay(on bool)`: SetNoDelay turns Nagle's algorithm off (true) or on.
- `(c Conn) Write(s str) !`: Write sends all of s.
- `(c Conn) WriteBytes(b []u8) !`: WriteBytes sends all of b.
- `(c Conn) Read(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: Read appends up to max bytes to buf and returns how many; at the end it returns 0 and EOF.
- `(c Conn) ReadFull(n i64) !str`: ReadFull reads exactly n bytes.
- `(c mut Conn) Close()`: Close closes the connection.
- `Listen(addr str) !Listener`: Listen opens a TCP listener on "host:port" (":0" picks a free port: see Port).
- `(l Listener) Port() i64`: Port is the port the listener is bound to.
- `(c Conn) LocalPort() i64`: LocalPort is the port this end of the connection uses (what the peer sees as the source port).
- `(c Conn) CloseWrite()`: CloseWrite half-closes the connection: the peer reads the end of the stream after what was written, and this end still reads what the peer sends.
- `(l Listener) Accept() !Conn`: Accept waits for the next connection.
- `(l Listener) AcceptTimeout(timeout i64) !Conn`: AcceptTimeout waits at most timeout ns for the next connection (0: no limit), failing with a fault that says "timed out" when none came. A negative timeout is refused.
- `(l mut Listener) Close()`: Close stops listening.
- `type Options struct`: Options configure one client call (DoWith); the zero value is what Do uses.
- `const DefaultMaxIdle = 8`: DefaultMaxIdle is how many idle connections per host (and core) DoWith keeps when Options.MaxIdle is 0.
- `const DefaultMaxBody = 67108864`: DefaultMaxBody is the largest response body Do accepts (64 MiB, anvil's request limit): a larger one is a fault rather than memory a broken or hostile server can fill.
- `Get(url str) !Resp`: Get fetches url.
- `Post(url str, ctype str, body str) !Resp`: Post sends body with content type ctype to url.
- `Do(method str, url str, headers []str, body str) !Resp`: Do sends one request: headers is a list of name, value pairs. The method and header names must be tokens, and the URL and header values must not hold CR, LF, NUL or other control bytes (the URL no spaces either), or Do fails instead of sending a request an input could have split. Response bodies over DefaultMaxBody fail; DoWith sets a timeout and the limit.  Connections are kept alive: after a response that ends cleanly (HTTP/1.1, framed by a length or chunks, no "Connection: close") the connection waits in a per-core pool, by scheme, host and port (and TLS settings), and the next call to that host uses it instead of dialing and, for https, doing a TLS handshake. A kept connection is checked before it is used, dropped after 30 s idle, and at most Options.MaxIdle are kept per host. One the server closed meanwhile is replaced by a new connection without the caller seeing it, for a GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS or TRACE; any other method (a POST) fails instead of being sent twice.  Do does not follow redirects: a 3xx is returned as the response, with its Location header (Go follows up to 10). Response lines must end in CRLF; a response with bare LF line ends fails (Go accepts it).
- `DoWith(method str, url str, headers []str, body str, opt Options) !Resp`: DoWith is Do with options: an overall timeout and a response size limit.
- `(r Resp) Header(name str) str`: Header returns the response header name (any case), or "".
- `(r Resp) Trailer(name str) str`: Trailer returns the response trailer name (any case), or "": HTTP/2 responses carry trailers (gRPC's grpc-status, for one; #480).

## tls

Package tls is TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) and TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246). Clients: tls.Dial connects and handshakes, and Conn reads and writes like wire.Conn; the server's certificate is verified by default against the system's roots (plus Config.RootCAs). A server's NewSessionTicket is kept (per core, for the same name and settings) and offered on the next connection to it, which then resumes without the certificate messages (Conn.Resumed). Servers: anvil.ServeTLS serves HTTPS with this package; LoadServerConfig reads a certificate chain and its key (RSA, ECDSA P-256 or P-384), and Server runs the server side over an accepted wire.Conn. Cipher suites: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256; key exchange X25519MLKEM768 (post-quantum hybrid, ML-KEM-768 with X25519) or X25519, or P-256 by HelloRetryRequest. TLS 1.2, for peers that stop there, has the six ECDHE suites with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 and the extended master secret; 1.3 is preferred, and Config.MinVersion (ServerConfig.MinVersion) VersionTLS13 turns 1.2 off. No 0-RTT, no renegotiation, no 1.2 session resumption and nothing older than 1.2. Every wait lets the core serve other tasks and honours Config.Timeout during the handshake, SetTimeout afterwards and a request's deadline.

```tin body
let c = try tls.Dial("example.com:443", tls.Config{ALPN: []str{"http/1.1"}})
try c.Write("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
```

- `const NoClientCert = 0`: NoClientCert, RequestClientCert and RequireClientCert are ServerConfig.ClientAuth: ask for no client certificate; ask for one and verify it when the client sends one; require a verified one.
- `const RequestClientCert = 1`
- `const RequireClientCert = 2`
- `CheckServerConfig(cfg ServerConfig) !`: CheckServerConfig checks the client-certificate settings of cfg before a server starts: a known ClientAuth, and ClientCAs that hold certificates when it asks for any.
- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a TLS 1.3 connection over a wire.Conn. After the handshake its memory only changes in place (record buffers made once, keys rewritten by seal.AEAD.Rekey), so a Conn stays valid wherever it lives: a request's pool, or keep()'s long-lived heap for a client that holds connections across requests.
- `const TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = 0x1301`: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 is cipher suite 0x1301 (Conn.CipherSuite).
- `const TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = 0x1302`: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 is cipher suite 0x1302.
- `const TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 = 0x1303`: TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 is cipher suite 0x1303.
- `type ServerConfig struct`: ServerConfig configures a TLS server: its certificate chain and private key, and the application protocols it speaks.
- `LoadServerConfig(certPEM str, keyPEM str) !ServerConfig`: LoadServerConfig reads a PEM certificate chain (leaf first) and the leaf's PEM private key and checks that they belong together.
- `Server(conn wire.Conn, cfg ServerConfig) !Conn`: Server runs the server side of the handshake over an accepted connection. The Conn owns conn from then on: its Close closes conn. Every wait lets the core serve other tasks.
- `ServerOnFd(fd i64, cfg ServerConfig) !Conn`: ServerOnFd runs the server handshake on a socket another package owns (anvil): the Conn never closes fd. Used with ReadRaw and SealRaw.
- `(c mut Conn) ReadRaw(p i64, cap i64) (i64, []u8)`: ReadRaw reads what the socket has without waiting, decrypts whole records and copies up to cap bytes of application data to the raw buffer at p. It returns the bytes copied (more than 0; -1 when nothing is available yet; 0 once the peer closed with close_notify or end of input; -2 when the connection is broken) and ciphertext the caller must send next: a KeyUpdate answer, or for -2 the alert to send before closing. It never waits.
- `(c mut Conn) ClosedRaw() (bool, []u8)`: ClosedRaw reports, without waiting, whether the peer has ended the connection: its close_notify or another alert arrived, the socket reached end of input, or it failed. It decrypts what the socket has, record by record, and stops at the first one of application data, which stays buffered for ReadRaw; a KeyUpdate answer (or the alert to send) is returned for the caller to send. For a stream that asks whether its client went away: a peek at the socket sees only ciphertext.
- `SealRawSize(n i64) i64`: SealRawSize is the most bytes SealRawTo writes for n bytes of application data.
- `(c mut Conn) SealRaw(p i64, n i64) ![]u8`: SealRaw encrypts n bytes of application data at the raw address p into records (16 KiB each, a KeyUpdate first when the write key is worn out) for the caller to send.
- `(c mut Conn) SealRawTo(p i64, n i64, dst i64) !i64`: SealRawTo is SealRaw into raw memory at dst, which holds SealRawSize(n) bytes; it returns the bytes written. Each record is built and sealed in place there, so nothing it allocates grows with n: an event loop seals into a buffer it reuses.
- `(c mut Conn) CloseNotifyRaw() []u8`: CloseNotifyRaw is the close_notify alert record to send before closing.
- `(c Conn) PendingRaw() bool`: PendingRaw reports whether the Conn holds input ReadRaw has not returned yet: decrypted data, or bytes of a record read from the socket. An event loop that stopped reading (its output was blocked) calls ReadRaw again when this is true, since the socket will not report that input.
- `(c mut Conn) ReleaseRaw()`: ReleaseRaw ends a Conn kept in long-lived memory before its owner drops it: it marks it closed and resets the failure text, which a failed Read or Write made in a request's pool, so releasing the Conn never follows a pointer into a pool that is gone. Nothing is sent.
- `SetTicketSecret(key secret []u8) !`: SetTicketSecret sets the 32-byte secret the server's session-ticket keys are derived from. Servers that share it (several processes behind one load balancer) resume each other's sessions. Call it before the server starts; the default is a random secret per process, or the 64 hex digits of TIN_TLS_TICKET_SECRET.
- `type Credential struct`: Credential is a certificate chain (DER, leaf first), its private key, and the names its leaf covers (its DNS names and IP addresses, lower case), for ServerConfig.Others.
- `LoadCredential(certPEM str, keyPEM str) !Credential`: LoadCredential reads a PEM certificate chain (leaf first) and the leaf's PEM private key and checks that they belong together.
- `type Config struct`: Config configures a client connection; the zero value verifies the server against the system's roots for the name in the address.
- `Dial(addr str, cfg Config) !Conn`: Dial connects to "host:port" and runs the handshake. ServerName defaults to host.
- `Client(conn wire.Conn, cfg Config) !Conn`: Client runs the handshake over an established connection, for protocols that switch to TLS mid-stream (MySQL, PostgreSQL). cfg.ServerName is required unless InsecureSkipVerify is set. The Conn owns conn from then on: its Close closes conn.
- `(c mut Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c mut Conn) SetDeadline(at i64)`: SetDeadline makes every later wait fail once the monotonic clock (tide.Now) passes at (0: no deadline), whatever the per-call timeout: wire uses it for a whole HTTP call.
- `(c Conn) ALPN() str`: ALPN is the application protocol the server chose ("" when none).
- `(c Conn) CipherSuite() i64`: CipherSuite is the negotiated cipher suite (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and so on).
- `(c Conn) Group() str`: Group is the key exchange: "X25519MLKEM768" (post-quantum hybrid, #479), "X25519", or "P-256" when the server asked for it.
- `const VersionTLS13 = 0x0304`: VersionTLS13 is TLS 1.3's protocol version (Conn.Version).
- `(c Conn) Version() i64`: Version is the negotiated protocol version: VersionTLS13 or VersionTLS12.
- `(c Conn) Resumed() bool`: Resumed reports whether the handshake resumed an earlier session with a ticket: the server's certificate was checked on that session, and PeerCertificates is empty.
- `(c Conn) PeerCertificates() [][]u8`: PeerCertificates is the peer's certificate chain as sent (DER, leaf first): on a client the server's, on a server the client's when it sent one (mutual TLS, #475).
- `(c Conn) Fd() i64`: Fd is the connection's descriptor (for waiting on it; never read or write it directly).
- `(c Conn) Buffered() i64`: Buffered is how many decrypted bytes a Read returns without waiting.
- `(c mut Conn) Read(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: Read appends up to max bytes of application data to buf and returns how many; after the server's close_notify it fails with EOF (wire.IsEOF), and a connection the server drops without close_notify is a fault, not EOF (a truncation would otherwise look complete).
- `(c mut Conn) ReadNow(buf mut []u8, max i64) !i64`: ReadNow is Read without waiting: it returns 0 when no application data can be had without waiting for the socket (then wait until Fd is readable and call it again). For clients that run their own non-blocking loop; data TLS has already buffered is always returned first.
- `(c mut Conn) ReadNowTo(p i64, max i64) !i64`: ReadNowTo is ReadNow into the raw buffer at p, at most max bytes: for trusted code that keeps its own buffers (the kafka client reads frames of many megabytes this way, with no copy per record).
- `(c mut Conn) ReadFull(n i64) !str`: ReadFull reads exactly n bytes.
- `(c mut Conn) WriteBytes(b []u8) !`: WriteBytes sends all of b.
- `(c mut Conn) Write(s str) !`: Write sends all of s.
- `(c mut Conn) Close()`: Close sends close_notify and closes the connection; closing twice does nothing.
- `const VersionTLS12 = 0x0303`: VersionTLS12 is TLS 1.2's protocol version (Conn.Version, Config.MinVersion).
- `const TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = 0xc02b`: The TLS 1.2 cipher suites (all ECDHE with an AEAD).
- `const TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = 0xc02c`
- `const TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 = 0xc02f`
- `const TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = 0xc030`
- `const TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 = 0xcca8`
- `const TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 = 0xcca9`

## hpack

Package hpack is HPACK (RFC 7541), HTTP/2's header compression, for HTTP/2 clients (wire, #480): a Decoder that keeps one connection's dynamic table and decodes Huffman-coded strings, and Encode, which writes a header list with static-table names and plain literals that are never indexed, so it keeps no state and adds nothing to the peer's table. anvil's server has its own decoder, which hands fields over without copying them.

```tin body
mut block = make([]u8, 0, 64)
hpack.Encode(mut block, []hpack.Field{hpack.Field{Name: ":status", Value: "200"}})
let d = hpack.NewDecoder(4096, 65536)
let fields = try d.Decode(block)
```

- `type Field struct`: Field is one header field.
- `type Decoder struct`: Decoder decodes the header blocks one peer sends on a connection, in order: its dynamic table carries from block to block. The table is in malloc'd memory, so a decoder kept with a connection outlives the requests that used it; Free releases it.
- `NewDecoder(tableSize i64, listMax i64) Decoder`: NewDecoder is a decoder for a peer allowed a table of tableSize bytes (4096 unless the connection's settings say otherwise, at most 8192) whose header lists stay within listMax bytes.
- `(d Decoder) Free()`: Free releases the decoder's table; the decoder must not be used again.
- `(d Decoder) Decode(block []u8) ![]Field`: Decode decodes one header block (the fragments of a HEADERS frame and its CONTINUATIONs, joined). An error is a COMPRESSION_ERROR: the connection must end, since the table is no longer the peer's.
- `Encode(b mut []u8, fields []Field)`: Encode appends the header block of fields to b: a static entry where one matches name and value exactly, else a literal without indexing (with a static name where there is one). Names must be lowercase, as HTTP/2 requires.

## twine

- `Join(elems []str, sep str) str`: Join concatenates elems with sep between them.
- `Repeat(s str, count i64) str`: Repeat returns s concatenated count times (empty when count <= 0; panics when the length overflows).

- `(b mut Builder) Reset()`: Reset empties the Builder but keeps its capacity.
- `Map(mapping fn(i32) i32, s str) str`: Map returns s with every rune replaced by mapping(rune); a rune mapped to a negative value is dropped. Invalid UTF-8 bytes reach mapping as U+FFFD, and a rune mapped to it is written as U+FFFD.
- `ToUpper(s str) str`: ToUpper returns s with every letter mapped to upper case.
- `ToLower(s str) str`: ToLower returns s with every letter mapped to lower case.
- `ToTitle(s str) str`: ToTitle returns s with every letter mapped to title case.
- `Title(s str) str`: Title returns s with the first letter of each word mapped to title case. It cannot tell where words start in every script (the apostrophe in "they're" starts one): it is Go's deprecated strings.Title.
- `EqualFold(s str, t str) bool`: EqualFold reports whether s and t are equal under Unicode simple case folding.
- `Fields(s str) []str`: Fields splits s around runs of white space (Unicode's) and returns the non-empty pieces.

- `TrimFunc(s str, f fn(i32) bool) str`: TrimFunc returns s without the leading and trailing runes for which f is true.

## glyph

Package glyph is UTF-8 (like Go's unicode/utf8) and Unicode: general categories, scripts, properties and case mapping, from the same tables as Go's unicode package (see UnicodeVersion).

- `const RuneError = 0xfffd`: RuneError is the replacement character returned for invalid UTF-8.
- `const MaxRune = 0x10ffff`: MaxRune is the largest valid Unicode code point.
- `const UTFMax = 4`: UTFMax is the maximum number of bytes one encoded rune occupies.
- `ValidRune(r i32) bool`: ValidRune reports whether r can be legally encoded as UTF-8.
- `RuneLen(r i32) i64`: RuneLen returns the number of bytes needed to encode r, or -1 if r is not a valid rune.
- `EncodeRune(b mut []u8, r i32) i64`: EncodeRune appends the UTF-8 encoding of r to b (RuneError if invalid) and returns the byte count.
- `RuneStr(r i32) str`: RuneStr returns r encoded as a one-rune string (RuneError if invalid).
- `DecodeRune(s str, i i64) (i32, i64)`: DecodeRune decodes the rune starting at byte i of s, returning (RuneError, 1) for bad bytes and (RuneError, 0) at the end.
- `DecodeLastRune(s str, end i64) (i32, i64)`: DecodeLastRune decodes the last rune of s[0:end], returning its rune and size ((RuneError, 0) when end <= 0).
- `RuneStart(b u8) bool`: RuneStart reports whether byte b could be the first byte of an encoded rune (not a continuation byte).

## link

Package link parses, builds and resolves URLs, and escapes and unescapes their parts (like Go's net/url). A URL is a struct; its User is an optional (nil when the URL has no userinfo); query parameters are a Values, a small wrapper over map[str][]str whose keys keep insertion order and whose Encode sorts them. Faults carry Go's messages: parse "x": invalid URL escape "%zz".

- `QueryUnescape(s str) !str`: QueryUnescape converts each %AB in s to the byte 0xAB and each + to a space; a % not followed by two hex digits is a fault.
- `PathUnescape(s str) !str`: PathUnescape is QueryUnescape for a path segment: + stays a plus sign.
- `QueryEscape(s str) str`: QueryEscape escapes s for use as a query key or value: a space becomes +.
- `PathEscape(s str) str`: PathEscape escapes s for use as one path segment: / and ? are escaped too.
- `type Userinfo struct`: Userinfo is the username and optional password of a URL.
- `User(username str) Userinfo`: User returns a Userinfo with a username and no password.
- `UserPassword(username str, password str) Userinfo`: UserPassword returns a Userinfo with a username and a password (only for legacy services: RFC 2396 warns against passwords in URLs).
- `(u Userinfo) Username() str`: Username returns the username.
- `(u Userinfo) Password() (str, bool)`: Password returns the password and whether one is set.
- `(u Userinfo) String() str`: String returns the escaped userinfo, username[:password].
- `type URL struct`: URL is a parsed URL, in the general form [scheme:][//[userinfo@]host][/]path[?query][#fragment]. A URL whose rest after the scheme does not start with a slash is opaque: scheme:opaque[?query][#fragment]. Path and Fragment are stored decoded; RawPath and RawFragment hold the original encoding when it differs from the default one (EscapedPath and EscapedFragment use them).
- `(u URL) Clone() URL`: Clone returns a copy of u (a plain assignment of a struct shares it).
- `Parse(rawURL str) !URL`: Parse parses a URL, absolute or relative; a hostname and path without a scheme is invalid but may not be rejected, because of parsing ambiguities.
- `ParseRequestURI(rawURL str) !URL`: ParseRequestURI parses a URL received in an HTTP request: an absolute URI or an absolute path, without a #fragment.
- `(u URL) EscapedPath() str`: EscapedPath returns u.RawPath when it is a valid encoding of u.Path, else the default escaping.
- `(u URL) EscapedFragment() str`: EscapedFragment returns u.RawFragment when it is a valid encoding of u.Fragment, else the default.
- `(u URL) Username() str`: Username returns the username of u's userinfo, or "".
- `(u URL) Password() (str, bool)`: Password returns the password of u's userinfo and whether one is set.
- `(u URL) String() str`: String reassembles u into a URL string: [scheme:][//[userinfo@]host][/]path[?query][#fragment].
- `(u URL) Redacted() str`: Redacted is String with the password, if any, replaced by xxxxx.
- `(u URL) IsAbs() bool`: IsAbs reports whether u has a scheme.
- `(u URL) Hostname() str`: Hostname returns u.Host without its port, and without the brackets of an IPv6 literal.
- `(u URL) Port() str`: Port returns the port of u.Host, or "" when there is none.
- `(u URL) RequestURI() str`: RequestURI returns what goes in an HTTP request line: the escaped path (or / when empty) and query, or the opaque part.
- `(u URL) Query() Values`: Query parses u.RawQuery, keeping every well-formed parameter and skipping malformed ones.
- `(u URL) Parse(ref str) !URL`: Parse parses ref (which may be relative) in the context of u: Parse then ResolveReference.
- `(u URL) ResolveReference(ref URL) URL`: ResolveReference resolves a URI reference against u as an absolute URI (RFC 3986 section 5.2): ref may be relative or absolute, and u is typically an absolute URL.
- `(u URL) JoinPath(elems []str) URL`: JoinPath returns a copy of u with the elements joined onto its path (cleaned, with a trailing slash kept if the last element had one).
- `JoinPath(base str, elems []str) !str`: JoinPath parses base and joins the elements onto its path, returning the URL as a string.
- `type Values struct`: Values maps a query key to its values, in the order they were added; Encode sorts the keys.
- `NewValues() Values`: NewValues returns an empty Values.
- `(v Values) Get(key str) str`: Get returns the first value of key, or "" when there is none.
- `(v Values) All(key str) []str`: All returns every value of key (empty when there is none).
- `(v mut Values) Set(key str, value str)`: Set makes value the only value of key.
- `(v mut Values) Add(key str, value str)`: Add appends value to the values of key.
- `(v mut Values) Del(key str)`: Del removes key and its values.
- `(v Values) Has(key str) bool`: Has reports whether key is present.
- `(v Values) Keys() []str`: Keys returns the keys in the order they were first added.
- `(v Values) Len() i64`: Len returns the number of keys.
- `ParseQuery(query str) !Values`: ParseQuery parses a URL query ("a=1&b=2&a=3") into Values. It faults on the first malformed parameter (a bad escape, or a semicolon separator); URL.Query keeps the good ones instead.
- `(v Values) Encode() str`: Encode returns the values URL-encoded ("a=1&a=3&b=2"), sorted by key.

## netip

Package netip holds IP addresses, address/port pairs and prefixes as small value types, like Go's net/netip. An Addr is a value struct of 16 bytes, a zone and a kind byte: it is copied by every store, compares with == and is a map key by value. Comparing, classifying, Contains, Overlaps and AppendTo allocate nothing.

```tin body
let a = try netip.ParseAddr("192.168.1.10")
let p = try netip.ParsePrefix("192.168.0.0/16")
p.Contains(a)                                   // true
a.IsPrivate()                                   // true
let ap = try netip.ParseAddrPort("[fe80::1%eth0]:8080")
ap.Port()                                       // 8080
ap.Addr().Zone()                                // "eth0"
```

Parsing, formatting, the fault messages and every classification follow net/netip exactly: an IPv4 address is stored as its IPv4-mapped IPv6 form with the IPv4 kind, IPv4 fields with leading zeros are refused, an IPv6 address may end in an embedded IPv4 address and carry a zone after %, and the zero Addr is invalid.

- `MustParseAddrPort(s str) AddrPort`: MustParseAddrPort is ParseAddrPort that panics with the fault's message.
- `(p AddrPort) Compare(q AddrPort) i64`: Compare is -1, 0 or +1 as p sorts before, with or after q: by address, then port.
- `(p AddrPort) AppendTo(b mut []u8) []u8`: AppendTo appends p's text form (String) to b, nothing when p's address is the zero Addr, and returns b.
- `(p AddrPort) String() str`: String is "1.2.3.4:80", "[2001:db8::1]:80" or "invalid AddrPort".
- `(p AddrPort) MarshalText() []u8`: MarshalText is p's text form as bytes, empty when p's address is the zero Addr.
- `(p mut AddrPort) UnmarshalText(text []u8) !`: UnmarshalText sets p from its text form; empty text gives the zero AddrPort.
- `PrefixFrom(ip Addr, bits i64) Prefix`: PrefixFrom is the prefix of ip's first bits bits, with ip's zone dropped and its other bits kept (see Masked); bits out of range for ip, or the zero Addr, give an invalid Prefix.

- `AppendInt(b mut []u8, v i64) []u8`: AppendInt appends v in decimal.
- `AppendUint(b mut []u8, v u64) []u8`: AppendUint appends v in decimal.
- `AppendHex(b mut []u8, v u64) []u8`: AppendHex appends v in lower-case hexadecimal (no prefix).
- `Reset(b mut []u8)`: Reset empties b, keeping its capacity.
- `Truncate(b mut []u8, n i64)`: Truncate keeps the first n bytes of b.
- `ToStr(b []u8) str`: ToStr returns b's bytes as a str.
- `TrimSpace(b []u8) []u8`: TrimSpace returns b without leading and trailing ASCII white space (a sub-slice).

## flume

Package flume reads and writes file descriptors through 64 KiB buffers: lines, whole files and buffered output with one write per flush.

- `type Reader struct`: Reader buffers reads from a file descriptor. Inside a task it waits on a pipe, socket or terminal through rt_task_wait, so a deadline or cancel fails the read (the next read retries).
- `type Writer struct`: Writer buffers writes to a file descriptor.
- `New(fd i64) Reader`: New reads from fd.
- `Open(path str) !Reader`: Open reads the file at path.
- `(r mut Reader) Close()`: Close closes the reader's descriptor.
- `(r mut Reader) Line() !(str, bool)`: Line returns the next line without its "\n" (or "\r\n"); ok is false at the end.
- `(r mut Reader) Byte() (u8, bool)`: Byte returns the next byte; ok is false at the end.
- `(r mut Reader) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read fills buf with the next buffered bytes, waiting for them, and returns how many it wrote: 0 at the end. It is what makes a flume.Reader an io.Reader (ledger.NewStream).
- `(r mut Reader) ReadByte() !(u8, bool)`: ReadByte returns the next byte; ok is false at the end. It makes a flume.Reader an io.ByteReader.
- `(r mut Reader) ReadRune() !(i32, i64)`: ReadRune returns the next UTF-8 encoded rune and its size in bytes: size 0 at the end, and U+FFFD of size 1 for an invalid encoding, as Go's bufio.Reader does. It makes a flume.Reader an io.RuneReader.
- `(r mut Reader) ReadAll() !str`: ReadAll returns everything left.
- `ReadFile(path str) !str`: ReadFile returns the contents of the file at path.
- `NewWriter(fd i64) Writer`: NewWriter writes to fd.
- `Stdout() Writer`: Stdout writes to standard output (flush it before mixing with say output).
- `Create(path str) !Writer`: Create truncates or creates the file at path for writing.
- `CreateExcl(path str) !Writer`: CreateExcl creates the file at path for writing (mode 0644) only if nothing exists there yet; two processes that race for one path never both succeed, which makes it the basis of lock files.
- `(w mut Writer) Sync() !`: Sync flushes the writer and waits until the file is on stable storage (fsync; on macOS F_FULLFSYNC).
- `(w mut Writer) Str(s str)`: Str appends s.
- `(w mut Writer) Byte(c u8)`: Byte appends c.
- `(w mut Writer) Write(data []u8) !i64`: Write appends data, flushing first when the buffer would pass 64 KiB, and returns len(data); it fails with the writer's fault (a failed flush, or a closed writer). It makes a flume.Writer an io.Writer.
- `(w mut Writer) WriteString(s str) !i64`: WriteString is Write for a str (an io.StringWriter).
- `(w mut Writer) WriteByte(c u8) !`: WriteByte is Write for one byte (an io.ByteWriter).
- `(w mut Writer) Int(v i64)`: Int appends v in decimal.
- `(w mut Writer) Line(s str)`: Line appends s and a newline.
- `(w mut Writer) Flush() !`: Flush writes everything buffered (with as few writes as the descriptor allows).
- `(w mut Writer) Close() !`: Close flushes and closes the writer's descriptor once; closing again (or a writer that never opened) is a fault.

## quarry

Package quarry is the operating system interface (like Go's os): arguments, environment, files and directories.

- `type FileType enum`: FileType is what a path is.
- `type FileInfo struct`: FileInfo is what stat and lstat report about a path. Times are unix nanoseconds.
- `type DirEntry struct`: DirEntry is a name in a directory with its type.
- `Stat(path str) !FileInfo`: Stat describes the file at path, following symlinks.
- `Lstat(path str) !FileInfo`: Lstat describes the file at path; a symlink is described itself, not followed.
- `Chmod(path str, perm i64) !`: Chmod sets the permission bits (the low 12 bits of perm) of the file at path, following symlinks.
- `Symlink(target str, link str) !`: Symlink makes link a symlink to target.
- `Readlink(path str) !str`: Readlink is the target of the symlink at path.
- `Sync(path str) !`: Sync waits until the file or directory at path is on stable storage (fsync; on macOS F_FULLFSYNC, which also flushes the drive's cache). Sync a directory after creating or renaming in it.
- `ReadDirEntries(path str) ![]DirEntry`: ReadDirEntries lists the directory at path, sorted by name, with each entry's type. The type comes from the directory itself where the file system records it, and from lstat where it does not.
- `Alive(pid i64) bool`: Alive reports whether a process with this id exists on this machine (kill with signal 0; a process this one may not signal still exists).
- `Args() []str`: Args returns the command line, program name first.
- `Getenv(key str) str`: Getenv returns the value of environment variable key, or "" when it is unset.
- `LookupEnv(key str) (str, bool)`: LookupEnv returns the value of key and whether it is set (an empty value is still set).
- `Setenv(key str, value str) !`: Setenv sets environment variable key to value; an empty key or one holding '=' or NUL is a fault.
- `Unsetenv(key str) !`: Unsetenv removes environment variable key.
- `ReadFile(path str) !str`: ReadFile returns the whole content of the file at path. A file larger than 64 MiB (anvil's request limit) fails with fault.LimitExceeded before it is read, and so does a device or pipe past it, read by read (#745); ReadFileBound sets another bound.
- `ReadFileBound(path str, n i64) !str`: ReadFileBound returns the whole content of the file at path when it is at most n bytes, and otherwise fails with fault.LimitExceeded: a regular file by its size, before anything is read, a device or pipe as soon as more than n bytes have come (#745).
- `OpenRegular(path str) !(i64, i64)`: OpenRegular opens the regular file at path for reading and returns its descriptor and size; the caller closes the descriptor. Inside a request task it opens the file as ReadFile does: through the core's io_uring (Linux), or on a helper thread, always there under a slow mount, so an open that waits (a FIFO with no writer, a hung network mount) waits within the task's deadline and the core serves others meanwhile (#744). A directory ("is a directory"), a FIFO, a device or a socket ("not a regular file") is refused after the open: it has no size to send. It is for code that hands the file to the system, as anvil's SendFile does.
- `OpenRegularStat(path str) !(i64, i64, i64)`: OpenRegularStat is OpenRegular and the file's modification time too, in seconds since the Unix epoch: the descriptor, the size and the time, from one open and one fstat, never on the core thread.
- `ReadStdin() !str`: ReadStdin reads standard input to its end. Inside a task, from a pipe, socket or terminal, it waits through rt_task_wait: the core serves others, and a deadline or cancel fails it.
- `WriteFile(path str, data str) !`: WriteFile writes data to the file at path, creating it (mode 0644) or truncating it.
- `AppendFile(path str, data str) !`: AppendFile appends data to the file at path, creating it (mode 0644) when needed.
- `Exists(path str) bool`: Exists reports whether path names an existing file or directory (symlinks are followed).
- `IsDir(path str) bool`: IsDir reports whether path names a directory.
- `Size(path str) !i64`: Size returns the size in bytes of the file at path.
- `ModTime(path str) !i64`: ModTime returns the modification time of path in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- `Remove(path str) !`: Remove deletes the file or empty directory at path.
- `RemoveAll(path str) !`: RemoveAll deletes path and everything below it; a missing path is not a fault.
- `Rename(oldpath str, newpath str) !`: Rename moves oldpath to newpath, replacing a file there; like Go it never replaces a directory.
- `Mkdir(path str) !`: Mkdir creates the directory path (mode 0755); its parent must exist.
- `MkdirAll(path str) !`: MkdirAll creates path and any missing parents (mode 0755); an existing directory is fine.
- `SortStrs(a mut []str)`: SortStrs sorts a bytewise in place.
- `ReadDir(path str) ![]str`: ReadDir returns the names in directory path, sorted bytewise, without "." and "..".
- `Getwd() !str`: Getwd returns the current working directory ($PWD when it still names it, like Go).
- `Chdir(path str) !`: Chdir changes the current working directory to path.
- `TempDir() str`: TempDir returns the directory for temporary files: $TMPDIR, or /tmp.
- `Hostname() !str`: Hostname returns the machine's host name.
- `Pid() i64`: Pid returns the process id.
- `Exit(code i64)`: Exit flushes stdout and ends the program with status code.
- `Eprint(s str)`: Eprint writes s to stderr.
- `Eprintln(s str)`: Eprintln writes s and a newline to stderr in one write.

## spawn

Package spawn starts child processes, like Go's os/exec: Run a program and collect its output, or Start it, talk to it through pipes, signal it or kill it. A program is never run through a shell: write []str{"sh", "-c", script} for one. On Linux the child is a clone that execs and waits block on a pidfd; on macOS it is posix_spawn with file actions (POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT keeps the runtime's descriptors out of it) and the wait sleeps through the scheduler, which carries the task's deadline on both (#576).

- `type Stdio enum`: Stdio says where a child's standard descriptor points.
- `type Env enum`: Env says which environment a child gets. A Tin slice has no nil, so where Go's exec.Cmd says "nil inherits and an empty list is empty", this package says so with a variant.
- `type Cmd struct`: Cmd describes a program to start. Argv[0] is the program: a name without a slash is looked up in PATH.
- `type Process struct`: Process is a running child. Wait reaps it; a Process that is never waited for leaves a zombie.
- `type Result struct`: Result is a finished Run.
- `const SIGKILL = 9`: SIGKILL and SIGTERM are the signals Signal and Kill send.
- `const SIGTERM = 15`
- `const DefaultMaxOutput = 64 * 1024 * 1024`: DefaultMaxOutput is Run's cap on the stdout and stderr it collects: 64 MiB.
- `Start(c Cmd) !Process`: Start starts c and returns the running child. A start error names the program, like Go's exec.Error.
- `Run(c Cmd) !Result`: Run starts c, collects its output and waits for it. A non-empty Input is written to the child's standard input (which becomes a pipe) while the output is collected, so a child that answers while it reads does not deadlock; the pipe is closed after the last byte. Stdout and Stderr are captured unless they are File or Null; more than MaxOutput (DefaultMaxOutput when 0) bytes of the two together fail with fault.LimitExceeded and the child is killed. A non-zero exit is not a fault, and a task deadline (within) kills the child, reaps it and fails with fault.DeadlineExceeded.
- `(p mut Process) Wait() !i64`: Wait waits for the child, reaps it and returns its exit code, or -1 when a signal killed it. A task deadline (within) interrupts the wait, kills the child and reaps it.
- `(p Process) Pid() i64`: Pid is the child's process number.
- `(p Process) Signal(sig i64) !`: Signal sends sig to the child.
- `(p Process) Kill() !`: Kill sends SIGKILL to the child.
- `(p mut Process) Write(data str) !i64`: Write writes data to the child's standard input (Stdio.Pipe on Cmd.Stdin) and returns how many bytes went out. It never blocks the core: what the pipe cannot take yet waits for it to drain, so another task can read the child's output meanwhile. A task deadline interrupts the write with fault.DeadlineExceeded.
- `(p mut Process) CloseStdin() !`: CloseStdin closes the child's standard input, so a reader sees EOF.
- `(p Process) Read(buf mut []u8) !i64`: Read reads the child's standard output (Stdio.Pipe on Cmd.Stdout) into buf, up to its length, and returns how many bytes came; 0 is end of file.
- `(p Process) ReadStderr(buf mut []u8) !i64`: ReadStderr is Read for the child's standard error.
- `LookPath(name str) !str`: LookPath finds name like Go's exec.LookPath: a name with a slash is used as it is, otherwise each PATH entry is tried in order and the first executable file wins.

## trail

Package trail manipulates slash-separated file paths (like Go's path/filepath on Unix).

- `const Separator = '/'`: Separator is the path separator byte.
- `Clean(path str) str`: Clean returns the shortest path equivalent to path by Go's rules: no "." or ".." elements where avoidable, no repeated or trailing slashes, "." for an empty path.
- `IsAbs(path str) bool`: IsAbs reports whether path starts with a slash.
- `Base(path str) str`: Base returns the last element of path after dropping trailing slashes: "." for an empty path, "/" for all slashes.
- `Dir(path str) str`: Dir returns Clean of everything but the last element of path: "." when there is no slash.
- `Ext(path str) str`: Ext returns the suffix of path's last element from its final dot, or "".
- `Split(path str) (str, str)`: Split splits path right after its last slash into (dir, file); dir keeps the slash.
- `JoinAll(parts []str) str`: JoinAll joins the non-empty parts with slashes and Cleans the result; "" when every part is empty.
- `Join2(a str, b str) str`: Join2 joins two path elements like Go's filepath.Join(a, b).
- `Join3(a str, b str, c str) str`: Join3 joins three path elements like Go's filepath.Join(a, b, c).
- `Rel(base str, targ str) !str`: Rel returns a relative path that is lexically equivalent to targ when joined to base, or a fault when one is absolute and the other is not or base holds "..".
- `Match(pattern str, name str) !bool`: Match reports whether name matches the shell pattern: '*' (no slash), '?', '[a-z]', '[^x]' and '\' escapes, like Go's filepath.Match.

## lever

Package lever parses command-line flags (like Go's flag): register handles, Parse the arguments, then read .Val().

- `type Flag struct`: Flag is one registered flag; the typed handles below wrap it.
- `type StrFlag struct`: StrFlag is the handle of a string flag.
- `type IntFlag struct`: IntFlag is the handle of an integer flag.

- `Bool(name str, def bool, help str) BoolFlag`: Bool registers a boolean flag with its default and help text.
- `F64(name str, def f64, help str) F64Flag`: F64 registers a floating-point flag with its default and help text.

- `(h F64Flag) Val() f64`: Val returns the flag's value (its default until Parse sets it).
- `(h StrFlag) Given() bool`: Given reports whether the flag appeared on the command line.
- `(h IntFlag) Given() bool`: Given reports whether the flag appeared on the command line.
- `(h BoolFlag) Given() bool`: Given reports whether the flag appeared on the command line.
- `(h F64Flag) Given() bool`: Given reports whether the flag appeared on the command line.
- `Reset()`: Reset forgets every registered flag and parse result (for programs that parse several times).
- `Rest() []str`: Rest returns the arguments left after the flags (empty before Parse).
- `Parsed() bool`: Parsed reports whether Parse has run.
- `Set(name str, value str) !`: Set assigns value to the flag named name as if it were given on the command line.
- `Parse(args []str) !`: Parse reads flags from args (without the program name) until the first non-flag or "--"; the rest is kept for Rest().
- `Usage() str`: Usage returns the flags sorted by name, each with its value type, help and non-zero default, formatted exactly like Go's PrintDefaults.

## tty

Package tty is the terminal for command line programs: whether a descriptor is a terminal, its size, raw mode with a State that restores it, a pseudo-terminal pair for tests, and colour that turns itself off when the output is not a terminal, when NO_COLOR is set or when TERM is dumb.

- `type State struct`: State is a terminal's mode before Raw changed it; Close (or Restore) puts it back, so `use st = tty.Raw(0)` restores the terminal on every way out of the function.
- `IsTerminal(fd i64) bool`: IsTerminal reports whether fd is a terminal.
- `Size(fd i64) !(i64, i64)`: Size is the terminal's width and height in characters.
- `Raw(fd i64) !State`: Raw puts the terminal into raw mode (no echo, no line editing, no signals from keys, bytes as typed) and returns the state to restore.
- `Restore(st State) !`: Restore puts the terminal back as it was before Raw.
- `(st State) Close() !`: Close restores the terminal (for `use`).
- `IsRaw(fd i64) bool`: IsRaw reports whether the terminal at fd has echo and line editing off.
- `OpenPty() !(i64, i64)`: OpenPty opens a pseudo-terminal pair: the controlling side and the terminal side, as descriptors.
- `CloseFd(fd i64)`: CloseFd closes a descriptor OpenPty gave.
- `Colors(fd i64) bool`: Colors reports whether colour should be written to fd: it is a terminal, NO_COLOR is unset and TERM is not dumb.
- `Paint(on bool, code str, s str) str`: Paint wraps s in the SGR code (such as "1" bold, "31" red, "32" green, "2" dim) when on is true, else returns s.

## tide

Package tide is clocks, durations, civil (calendar) time and time zones, like Go's time package. A Zone comes from the IANA database (TZif, RFC 8536): $ZONEINFO, the system directories, or the nested package tide/tzdata, which embeds the whole database for images with no /usr/share/zoneinfo (import it for its side effect).

- `Truncate(ns i64, d i64) i64`: Truncate returns ns rounded down to a multiple of d since the zero time (0001-01-01), like Go's Time.Truncate; d <= 0 returns ns unchanged. A result outside Unix nanoseconds panics.
- `Round(ns i64, d i64) i64`: Round returns ns rounded to the nearest multiple of d since the zero time, with halfway values rounding up, like Go's Time.Round; d <= 0 returns ns unchanged. A result outside Unix nanoseconds panics.
- `AddDate(ns i64, z Zone, years i64, months i64, days i64) i64`: AddDate returns the instant years, months and days after ns in zone z, keeping the wall-clock fields like Go's Time.AddDate: January 31 plus one month lands in early March. Out-of-range fields carry the way DateIn does.
- `ISOWeek(c Civil) (i64, i64)`: ISOWeek returns the ISO 8601 year and week (1 to 53) of the civil date, like Go's Time.ISOWeek: week 1 is the week holding the first Thursday of the year.

- `const Kitchen = "3:04PM"`
- `const Stamp = "Jan _2 15:04:05"`
- `const StampMilli = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000"`
- `const StampMicro = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000"`
- `const StampNano = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000000"`
- `const DateTime = "2006-01-02 15:04:05"`
- `const DateOnly = "2006-01-02"`
- `const TimeOnly = "15:04:05"`
- `Format(ns i64, z Zone, layout str) str`: Format renders the instant ns in zone z with a reference-time layout, like Go's Time.Format.
- `Parse(layout str, value str, z Zone) !i64`: Parse parses value with a reference-time layout, like Go's time.ParseInLocation: a wall time with no zone in the value is read in z, while a zone offset or abbreviation is that instant (matched against z when it names one of z's zones). It returns Unix nanoseconds; malformed or out-of-range values fail with a parse fault (tide's message carries the layout and text).
- `const Nanosecond = 1`: Durations are i64 nanoseconds; these constants are the units, like Go's time.Duration.
- `const Microsecond = 1000`

- `Since(t i64) i64`: Since returns the nanoseconds elapsed since the Now() reading t.
- `Sleep(ns i64)`: Sleep pauses the running code for ns nanoseconds (nothing happens when ns <= 0); in a task, the core serves others meanwhile. A deadline or cancellation that comes first ends the sleep and leaves the way a safepoint does: the `within`, `limit` or `guard` block that owns it fails with its fault (fault.DeadlineExceeded), and a request past its deadline gets 504 (#527).
- `Wait(ns i64) !`: Wait pauses for ns like Sleep, but inside a request with a deadline it fails with "deadline exceeded" once the deadline comes first. On a server core, other requests run while one waits.
- `Seconds(d i64) f64`: Seconds returns d as floating-point seconds, like Go's Duration.Seconds.
- `Minutes(d i64) f64`: Minutes returns d as floating-point minutes.
- `Hours(d i64) f64`: Hours returns d as floating-point hours.

- `ParseDuration(s str) !i64`: ParseDuration parses "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m" (units ns us µs ms s m h) exactly like Go's time.ParseDuration.
- `type Civil struct`: Civil is a broken-down instant: Month 1..12, Day 1..31, Weekday 0 (Sunday)..6, YearDay 1..366, and, from In, the zone's Offset in seconds east of UTC and its abbreviation in Zone.
- `IsLeap(year i64) bool`: IsLeap reports whether year is a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
- `DaysIn(year i64, month i64) i64`: DaysIn returns the number of days in month (1..12) of year, or 0 for a month out of range.
- `DaysFromCivil(y i64, m i64, d i64) i64`: DaysFromCivil returns the days from 1970-01-01 to the date y-m-d (m 1..12; d may be out of range and carries).
- `CivilFromDays(z i64) (i64, i64, i64)`: CivilFromDays returns the (year, month, day) that is z days after 1970-01-01.
- `UTCSec(sec i64) Civil`: UTCSec breaks Unix seconds into UTC calendar fields (Nano is 0); it covers every i64 second.
- `UTC(ns i64) Civil`: UTC breaks the Unix-nanosecond instant ns into its UTC calendar fields.
- `Date(year i64, month i64, day i64, hour i64, min i64, sec i64, nano i64) i64`: Date returns the Unix nanoseconds of the UTC civil time; out-of-range fields carry like Go's time.Date (month 13 is January of the next year), and a time outside the years 1677..2262 that i64 nanoseconds hold panics (integer overflow).
- `Unix(c Civil) i64`: Unix returns the Unix nanoseconds of c (the inverse of UTC; Weekday and YearDay are ignored, other fields carry).
- `UnixSec(c Civil) i64`: UnixSec returns the Unix seconds of c, rounded toward negative infinity.
- `WeekdayName(d i64) str`: WeekdayName returns the English name of weekday d (0 = Sunday), or "%!Weekday(d)" with d unsigned like Go.
- `MonthName(m i64) str`: MonthName returns the English name of month m (1 = January), or "%!Month(m)" with m unsigned like Go.
- `FormatRFC3339(ns i64) str`: FormatRFC3339 renders the Unix-nanosecond instant ns as "2026-10-01T11:22:05Z" (whole seconds, UTC).
- `FormatRFC3339Nano(ns i64) str`: FormatRFC3339Nano is FormatRFC3339 with the fractional seconds, trailing zeros removed: "2026-10-01T11:22:05.5Z".
- `ParseRFC3339(s str) !i64`: ParseRFC3339 parses "2026-10-01T11:22:05Z", optional fraction ".123" and offsets "+02:00", accepting what Go's time.Parse(RFC3339) accepts, into Unix nanoseconds.
- `FormatHTTP(unixSec i64) str`: FormatHTTP renders Unix seconds in the HTTP date format "Thu, 01 Oct 2026 11:22:05 GMT".
- `type Zone struct`: Zone is a time zone: the transitions of the IANA database with the local time in effect after each, plus the TZ string that extends the zone past its last transition. A Zone is a handle that can be stored in a global; LoadZone caches one per core.
- `RegisterEmbedded(packed str) bool`: RegisterEmbedded installs the packed IANA database of tide/tzdata on this core: it inflates the DEFLATE stream (RFC 1951) into the container of u32 count; per zone, u32 name length, u32 data length, the name and the TZif bytes (RFC 8536), and keeps each zone's bytes. The package tide/tzdata calls it from its globals' initializer, on every core, before main; it reports whether the stream was well formed. LoadZone reads the database after $ZONEINFO and the system directories miss.
- `(z Zone) Name() str`: Name returns the zone's name, like "Europe/Paris".
- `UTCZone() Zone`: UTCZone returns the UTC zone.
- `FixedZone(name str, offset i64) Zone`: FixedZone returns a zone that is always offset seconds east of UTC, shown as name.
- `LoadZoneData(name str, data str) !Zone`: LoadZoneData parses the bytes of a TZif file (RFC 8536) as the zone called name, like Go's time.LoadLocationFromTZData.
- `LoadZone(name str) !Zone`: LoadZone returns the zone with an IANA name ("Europe/Paris", "Asia/Kathmandu", "UTC") from $ZONEINFO, the system directories and the database embedded by tide/tzdata, reading each name once per core. Unknown names fail with ErrUnknownZone (fault.Is). Loading reads files, and so needs the files capability.
- `Local() Zone`: Local returns the local zone: $TZ ("" is UTC, a path after ':' or a leading '/' is a file, "UTC" and names are looked up like LoadZone) or /etc/localtime when $TZ is unset, falling back to UTC, as Go's time.Local does.
- `In(ns i64, z Zone) Civil`: In returns the civil time of the instant ns in zone z, with Offset (seconds east of UTC) and Zone (the abbreviation, like "CET") set.
- `DateIn(year0 i64, month0 i64, day0 i64, hour0 i64, min0 i64, sec0 i64, nano0 i64, z Zone) i64`: DateIn returns the Unix nanoseconds of the civil time in zone z. Fields out of range carry like Date. A wall time in a gap (the clocks going forward) or an overlap (going back) picks the instant Go's time.Date picks: the one whose zone offset is valid there.

## dice

Package dice is fast pseudo-random numbers (like Go's math/rand): xoshiro256** generators and a lazily seeded per-core one.

## sift

Package sift sorts and searches slices and has the generic functions on them (like Go's sort, slices and cmp). Sort, SortFunc, IsSorted and the rest work on any element type; the type-specific functions (Ints, Strs, SortBy ...) are the faster, older forms.

- `Ints(xs mut []i64)`: Ints sorts xs in increasing order with pattern-defeating quicksort (not stable, O(n log n) worst case).
- `IntsDesc(xs mut []i64)`: IntsDesc sorts xs in decreasing order.
- `U64s(xs mut []u64)`: U64s sorts xs in increasing unsigned order.
- `F64s(xs mut []f64)`: F64s sorts xs in increasing order with NaNs first, like Go's slices.Sort (-0 sorts before 0).

- `SortBy(xs mut []i64, less fn(i64, i64) bool)`: SortBy sorts xs so that less(xs[i+1], xs[i]) is never true (less must be a strict weak order).
- `HeapInts(xs mut []i64)`: HeapInts sorts xs in increasing order with heapsort (slower than Ints, no recursion, no extra memory).

- `shape Ordered = i64 | i32 | i16 | i8 | u64 | u32 | u16 | u8 | f64 | f32 | str`: Ordered is the set of built-in types with a total ordering operator.
- `Sort[E Ordered](xs mut []E)`: Sort sorts xs in ascending order, in place. Floating-point NaNs sort first. It is not stable, and the order of equal elements is the same as Go's slices.Sort.

- `Replace[E constraints.Any](xs mut []E, i i64, j i64, vs []E) []E`: Replace replaces xs[i:j] with vs and returns the resulting slice (grown or shrunk in place).
- `Compact[E constraints.Comparable](xs mut []E) []E`: Compact removes runs of equal consecutive elements, keeping the first of each run, in place, and returns the shorter slice.

It is not a cryptographic hash, and it is not Go's hash/maphash (whose algorithm is not specified and whose seed is random): two runs with the same seed and the same bytes agree, and different seeds give unrelated hashes.

## squash

Package squash compresses and decompresses: DEFLATE (RFC 1951) and its gzip (RFC 1952) and zlib (RFC 1950) wrappers like Go's compress/flate, compress/gzip and compress/zlib, plus Snappy, LZ4, Zstandard (RFC 8878), LZW (compress/lzw) and bzip2 decompression (compress/bzip2). Every decoder takes the most bytes it may produce and fails with fault.LimitExceeded past it, so a small input cannot make a huge output.

```tin body
let z = squash.Gzip("hello, hello, hello", squash.Default)
let back = try squash.Gunzip(z, 64mb)
```

- `Bunzip2(data str, max i64) !str`: Bunzip2 decompresses bzip2 data (one stream or several back to back, as Go's compress/bzip2 reads them), checking every block CRC and stream CRC and failing past max bytes of output.
- `Deflate(data str, level i64) str`: Deflate compresses data as raw DEFLATE at level (Store to Best).
- `const Store = 0`: Levels for Deflate, Gzip, Zlib and Zstd: Store writes the data uncompressed (in valid frames), Fastest and Best trade speed against size, Default is between.
- `const Fastest = 1`
- `const Default = 6`
- `const Best = 9`
- `Inflate(data str, max i64) !str`: Inflate decompresses raw DEFLATE data, producing at most max bytes.

- `Unzlib(data str, max i64) !str`: Unzlib decompresses zlib data, producing at most max bytes, and checks its Adler-32.

- `const LSB = 1`
- `Lzw(data str, order i64) str`: Lzw compresses data with LZW, literal width 8, as Go's lzw.Writer does: a clear code starts the stream, the dictionary grows to 4096 codes and then a clear code starts it again, and the stream ends with the end code.
- `Unlzw(data str, order i64, max i64) !str`: Unlzw decompresses an LZW stream of the given order, failing past max bytes.
- `Snappy(data str) str`: Snappy compresses data as one Snappy block.
- `Unsnappy(data str, max i64) !str`: Unsnappy decompresses one Snappy block whose length is at most max.
- `shape Writer`: Writer is what a streaming compressor writes to: io.Writer's method.
- `type DeflateWriter[W Writer] struct`: DeflateWriter compresses raw DEFLATE into another writer, a chunk of up to 256 KiB at a time; Close ends the stream. Each chunk is compressed on its own (matches do not reach into the chunk before), which costs a little ratio and bounds the memory.
- `NewDeflateWriter[W Writer](out W, level i64) DeflateWriter[W]`: NewDeflateWriter is a raw DEFLATE writer into out at level.
- `NewZlibWriter[W Writer](out W, level i64) !DeflateWriter[W]`: NewZlibWriter is a zlib (RFC 1950) writer into out at level; Close writes the Adler-32 trailer.

- `Zstd(data str, level i64) str`: Zstd compresses data as one Zstandard frame at level (Store to Best; Store writes raw blocks).

## ledger

Package ledger reads and writes CSV records (RFC 4180), like Go's encoding/csv: quoting and escaping rules, \r\n normalization, comments, a fields-per-record check and parse faults with the record's line and column. The reader and writer port Go's encoding/csv (BSD licence: licenses/strconv.txt). Read faults carry the sentinels ErrBareQuote, ErrQuote, ErrFieldCount and ErrInvalidDelim (fault.Is), and Done at the end of the input.

A Reader over a stream holds a fixed window (64 KiB by default; NewStreamSize changes it) because Tin has no GC: the reader never grows or replaces its buffers, so a Read inside an arena frees its records with the arena, and streaming a huge file keeps a flat footprint. The window bounds a line: a longer one fails with fault.LimitExceeded. A Reader over an in-memory str has no window and no line limit. A comma or comment character is one byte (Go's encoding/csv accepts any rune); UTF-8 delimiters are a known gap.

- `type Reader struct`: Reader reads records from CSV text, like Go's csv.Reader. Set the exported fields before the first Read: Comma and Comment are single bytes.
- `NewReader(text str) Reader`: NewReader reads records from text.
- `NewStream[S io.Reader](src S) Reader`: NewStream reads records from a stream in a 64 KiB window (see NewStreamSize).
- `NewStreamSize[S io.Reader](src S, maxLine i64) Reader`: NewStreamSize is NewStream with a window of maxLine bytes (0 gives the default 64 KiB); a line longer than the window fails with fault.LimitExceeded.
- `(r mut Reader) ReadAll() ![][]str`: ReadAll returns the remaining records; a parse fault stops it instead, like Read.
- `(r Reader) Pos() (i64, i64)`: Pos returns the line and column where the record of the last successful Read started (1-based), or (0, 0) before any Read.
- `TrimBOM(s str) str`: TrimBOM returns s without a leading UTF-8 byte order mark; a BOM elsewhere (the Reader itself does not strip one, as Go's encoding/csv does not) is an ordinary field byte.
- `(r mut Reader) Read() ![]str`: Read returns the next record: the fields with their quotes removed and escapes decoded, or the fault Done at the end of the input. A parse fault carries one of ErrBareQuote, ErrQuote, ErrFieldCount or ErrInvalidDelim (fault.Is) and the record's position in its message. On a parse fault no partial record is returned, where Go's Read returns the fields read so far.
- `type Writer struct`: Writer writes records in CSV form into a buffer, like Go's csv.Writer. Set the exported fields before the first Write.
- `NewWriter() Writer`: NewWriter returns a Writer with Comma set to ','.
- `(w mut Writer) Write(fields []str) !`: Write appends one record, quoting fields that hold the delimiter, a quote, a newline or a leading space, and doubling quotes, as Go's encoding/csv does.
- `(w mut Writer) WriteAll(records [][]str) !`: WriteAll writes every record in order.
- `(w Writer) String() str`: String returns the bytes written so far as a str.

## abacus

Package abacus is arbitrary-precision integers, like Go's math/big.Int, with value semantics: every operation returns a new value and leaves its operands alone. A value is a sign and a little-endian magnitude of 64-bit limbs, normalized (no leading zero limbs; zero is an empty magnitude with a false sign).

It is not constant-time: use seal for cryptography. There is no formatting hook in say yet, so print an Int with x.Str() or x.Text(base) (see design/stdlib_verified.md).

- `type Int struct`: Int is an arbitrary-precision integer.
- `FromI64(v i64) Int`: FromI64 returns v as an Int.

## seal

Package seal has cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-1, SHA3-256, SHA3-512, and SHAKE128 and SHAKE256), HMAC over any of the SHA-2 hashes, HKDF, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256, AES and DES/3DES block ciphers, CBC, CTR, CFB and OFB modes, RC4, PKCS #7 padding, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, P-256 ECDH, ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203), RSA signature verification (PKCS #1 v1.5 and PSS), X.509 certificates with chain and host name verification, constant-time comparison, secure random bytes, the hex, base64 and PEM encodings, and RSA-OAEP encryption with a public key. MD5, DES/3DES, RC4, CBC, CFB and OFB are for legacy interoperability only; prefer an authenticated cipher for new protocols.

- `type AEAD struct`: AEAD is an authenticated cipher with its key (AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305): Seal encrypts and appends a 16-byte tag, Open checks the tag in constant time and decrypts.
- `NewChaCha20Poly1305(key secret []u8) !AEAD`: NewChaCha20Poly1305 is the RFC 8439 AEAD with a 32-byte key.
- `(a AEAD) NonceSize() i64`: NonceSize is the nonce length in bytes (12).
- `(a AEAD) Overhead() i64`: Overhead is the tag length in bytes (16).
- `(a AEAD) Seal(nonce []u8, plaintext secret []u8, aad []u8) ![]u8`: Seal encrypts plaintext and authenticates it with aad under a 12-byte nonce, returning the ciphertext followed by the tag. A nonce must never be used twice with one key.
- `(a AEAD) SealTo(nonce []u8, src i64, n i64, aad []u8, dst i64) !`: SealTo is Seal into raw memory: it encrypts the n bytes at src into dst and writes the 16-byte tag after them (dst may be src, to seal in place). Nothing it allocates grows with n, so a connection that streams can seal into a buffer of its own instead of its request's pool; AES-GCM on the CPU's instructions allocates nothing at all.
- `(a AEAD) Open(nonce []u8, sealed []u8, aad []u8) ![]u8`: Open checks the tag of sealed (ciphertext then tag) against aad and the nonce and returns the plaintext; it fails, revealing nothing else, when anything was changed.
- `(a mut AEAD) Rekey(key secret []u8) !`: Rekey replaces a's key with key, of the same algorithm and length, reusing a's memory: an AEAD kept in long-lived memory (a connection's state) can change keys without allocating there.
- `AESHardware() bool`: AESHardware reports whether AES-GCM runs on the CPU's AES instructions here (AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ, or ARMv8 AES and PMULL); without them it runs a slower constant-time software path and ChaCha20-Poly1305 is the faster choice.
- `NewAESGCM(key secret []u8) !AEAD`: NewAESGCM is AES-GCM (16-byte tags, 12-byte nonces) with a 16-, 24- or 32-byte key (AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256).
- `ArithDigest() str`: ArithDigest is the SHA-256 of the results of seal's multi-word arithmetic on a fixed set of operands (#488): the Montgomery multiplication and squaring for n = 2 to 48 limbs over random moduli and moduli of all-one limbs, with operands 0, 1, m-1, all-ones limbs and random values, z aliasing x and y; and the X25519 field multiplication and squaring on limbs of every size up to 2^52 - 1. Where the CPU's assembly (mont_mul, m4_mont, fe_mul_hw, fe_sq_hw) is in use the digest must equal the portable code's (run with TIN_SEAL_SOFT=1): the test pins the value.
- `shape Block`: Block is a block cipher with its key, as Go's cipher.Block; AES and DES satisfy it. Encrypt and Decrypt transform the first block of src into dst (dst may be src). EncryptBlocks and DecryptBlocks transform every whole block of src on its own: the batch form the modes call. On its own that is ECB, which shows which blocks are equal: never use it as a mode.
- `type AES struct`: AES is the AES block cipher with its key (AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256 by the key's length), as Go's aes.NewCipher; it satisfies Block. It keeps scratch space for its blocks, so it allocates nothing per call: use it on one core (not from a shared let).
- `NewAES(key secret []u8) !AES`: NewAES is AES with a 16-, 24- or 32-byte key; another length fails as Go's KeySizeError does.
- `(a AES) BlockSize() i64`: BlockSize is AES's block length, 16 bytes.
- `(a AES) Encrypt(dst mut []u8, src []u8)`: Encrypt encrypts the first 16 bytes of src into dst (dst may be src).

Two-key 3DES is a key whose last 8 bytes repeat the first. Deprecated.
- `(d DES) BlockSize() i64`: BlockSize is DES's block length, 8 bytes.
- `(d DES) Encrypt(dst mut []u8, src []u8)`: Encrypt encrypts the first 8 bytes of src into dst (dst may be src).

- `(d DES) EncryptBlocks(dst mut []u8, src []u8)`: EncryptBlocks encrypts every 8-byte block of src on its own into dst (the modes' batch form).
- `(d DES) DecryptBlocks(dst mut []u8, src []u8)`: DecryptBlocks decrypts every 8-byte block of src on its own into dst (the modes' batch form).
- `VerifyECDSA(curve str, pub []u8, digest []u8, sig []u8) !`: VerifyECDSA checks a DER-encoded ECDSA signature over digest (a hash of the message) by the public key pub, an uncompressed point on curve ("P-256" or "P-384").

- `SignECDSA(k ECPrivateKey, h Hash, digest []u8) ![]u8`: SignECDSA signs digest (a hash of the message, made with h) with k and returns a DER ECDSA-Sig-Value. The nonce is RFC 6979's, derived with HMAC over h, so equal inputs give equal signatures.

- `MLKEM768KeyFromSeed(seed secret []u8) !([]u8, []u8)`: MLKEM768KeyFromSeed is the key pair of a 64-byte seed d || z (FIPS 203's ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal, the seed form Go and BoringSSL keep): the decapsulation key (2400 bytes) and the encapsulation key (1184 bytes).
- `MLKEM768GenerateKey() ([]u8, []u8)`: MLKEM768GenerateKey makes a key pair from fresh randomness: the decapsulation key (2400 bytes) and the encapsulation key (1184 bytes).
- `MLKEM768Encapsulate(ek []u8) !([]u8, []u8)`: MLKEM768Encapsulate makes a shared key for the holder of encapsulation key ek: the shared key (32 bytes) and the ciphertext to send (1088 bytes). A key of the wrong size or with a value not below q is refused (FIPS 203's input check).

Empty data, data that is not whole blocks and wrong padding all fail with one fault, and the padding is read in time that depends only on bs. A CBC decryption that reports bad padding to an attacker who can send ciphertexts is a padding oracle: check a MAC first.
- `type BlockStream struct`: BlockStream is a Block run as a stream cipher (CTR, CFB or OFB), with its place in the keystream; it satisfies Stream. Never use one key and IV for two messages.

- `VerifyPKCS1v15(key RSAPublicKey, h Hash, digest []u8, sig []u8) !`: VerifyPKCS1v15 checks an RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature over digest, a hash made with h.
- `VerifyPSS(key RSAPublicKey, h Hash, digest []u8, sig []u8, saltLen i64) !`: VerifyPSS checks an RSASSA-PSS signature over digest, a hash made with h, with MGF1 over the same hash. saltLen is the exact salt length, or -1 to accept any.

- `Pbkdf2Sha256(password secret str, salt str, iterations i64, length i64) ![]u8`: Pbkdf2Sha256 derives length bytes using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256. Iterations must be positive; length must be between 0 and 1 MiB. Temporary storage is reused between rounds, so memory usage does not grow with iterations. Choose the work factor for your protocol or password policy (this function does not choose one). The password may be secret.
- `Pbkdf2Sha256Timeout(password secret str, salt str, iterations i64, length i64, timeout i64) ![]u8`: Pbkdf2Sha256Timeout derives bytes like Pbkdf2Sha256, with a timeout in nanoseconds (<= 0: no limit).

- `(c Certificate) CheckTLS12Signature(scheme i64, signed []u8, sig []u8) !`: CheckTLS12Signature verifies a TLS 1.2 signature (ServerKeyExchange, a client's CertificateVerify; #473) by c's key over signed. TLS 1.2 also allows RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 (0x0401, 0x0501, 0x0601), and its ECDSA schemes name only the hash, not the curve.
- `type CertPool struct`: CertPool is a set of certificates indexed by subject, used for roots and intermediates.
- `NewCertPool() CertPool`: NewCertPool returns an empty pool.
- `(p mut CertPool) Add(c Certificate)`: Add adds c to the pool unless it is already there.

The chain is returned leaf first, root last.
- `ParseIP(s str) ?[]u8`: ParseIP parses dotted IPv4 (4 bytes) or IPv6 text (16 bytes), optionally in brackets; nil if invalid.
- `(c Certificate) VerifyHostname(host str) !`: VerifyHostname checks that c is valid for host: an IP address against the IP SANs, otherwise a DNS name against the DNS SANs (case-insensitive, one leftmost "*" label followed by at least two labels; a host containing "*" never matches). The common name is not used.

## herald

Package herald writes leveled log lines, one write(2) per line so cores never interleave:

```text
2026-10-01T11:22:05.123Z INFO core=2 listening addr=:8080
```

- `const LDebug = 0`
- `const LInfo = 1`
- `const LWarn = 2`
- `const LError = 3`
- `SetLevel(l i64)`: SetLevel drops lines below l (LDebug, LInfo, LWarn, LError) on this core.
- `SetOutput(fd i64)`: SetOutput sends this core's lines to file descriptor fd.
- `SetClock(f fn() i64)`: SetClock replaces the clock (unix milliseconds), for tests.
- `Line(l i64, msg str, kv []str) str`: Line formats a log line (without writing it): timestamp, level, core, message, pairs.
- `Log(l i64, msg str, kv []str)`: Log writes msg at level l with key/value pairs kv (k1, v1, k2, v2, ...).

- `Error2(msg str, k str, v str)`: Error2 logs msg with one key/value pair at error level.

## crucible

Package crucible is for tests and micro-benchmarks: labeled checks that collect failures, Done to report them (exit status 1 on failure), and Bench to time a function.

```tin body
crucible.EqI("sum", 2 + 3, 5)
crucible.Done()
```

- `EqI(label str, got i64, want i64)`: EqI checks two integers.
- `EqU(label str, got u64, want u64)`: EqU checks two unsigned integers.

- `Bench(label str, n i64, f fn(i64))`: Bench runs f(i) for i in [0, n) and prints the time per call.
- `type T struct`: T is one running test: checks record failures in it, and the test continues.
- `type B struct`: B is one running benchmark: run the measured code b.N times.
- `Configure(pattern str, json bool)`: Configure sets how tin test runs the tests: pattern (a lasso regular expression, "" for every test) picks the tests and benchmarks whose names match, and json prints one JSON event per line instead of text (toolchain/docs/TOOLING.md section 5.2). A pattern that is not a regular expression ends the run with status 2.
- `(t mut T) Error(msg str)`: Error marks the test failed with msg (it keeps running).

- `Run(name str, f fn(mut T))`: Run runs one test and prints its result like go test -v (or as JSON events, see Configure); a test that does not match the -run pattern is not run.
- `RunBench(name str, f fn(mut B))`: RunBench runs one benchmark with b.N doubling until it takes at least 1 s, then prints the time per operation.
- `Finish()`: Finish prints PASS or FAIL and exits with status 1 when a test failed.

## constraints

Package constraints contains the named generic constraints used by the standard library.

- `shape Any {}`: Any imposes no operations on a type parameter.
- `shape Comparable {}`: Comparable admits values that can be compared by value, including structs and enums whose fields are all comparable. The compiler checks this property at each instantiation.

## policy

Package policy is the with policies (design_semantics §7.1, design/interface_policy.md): with p { body } calls p.Run(body) inside a boundary of its own, with the block as body. Slots are typed ambient values that Bind binds for a block and the tasks it spawns; Retry, Trace and Cached are the library policies.

- `shape Policy[T constraints.Any] { mut Run(body fn() !T) !T }`: Policy is what with p { body } needs of p: Run runs body (any number of times) and gives the block's value. Run may only call body, or pass it to a function that only calls it. Run is mut (#644): a policy may keep state between runs (CachedPolicy).
- `type Slot[T constraints.Any] struct`: Slot is a typed ambient value: with policy.Bind(s, v) { } binds it for the block and the tasks the block spawns.
- `NewSlot[T constraints.Any](name str) Slot[T]`: NewSlot makes a slot named name; declare it once, in a package-level let (one per core).
- `(s Slot[T]) Name() str`: Name is the slot's name.
- `(s Slot[T]) Get() !T`: Get is the value of the innermost Bind of s around the running code; it fails when s is not bound.
- `(s Slot[T]) Bound() bool`: Bound reports whether s is bound around the running code.
- `type BindPolicy[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any] struct`: BindPolicy binds a slot for its block (Bind).
- `Bind[V constraints.Any, T constraints.Any](s Slot[V], v V) BindPolicy[V, T]`: Bind is a policy that binds s to v for its block and the tasks the block spawns: with policy.Bind(requestID, id) { }.
- `(b BindPolicy[V, T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run binds the slot on the with block's boundary, then runs body once.
- `type RetryPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: RetryPolicy runs its block again while it fails (Retry).
- `Retry[T constraints.Any](attempts i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Retry is a policy that runs its block up to attempts times while it fails and gives the last fault. A cancellation ends it at once: a cancellation fault from the block is given as it is, and a boundary cancelled (or past its deadline) between attempts gives the cancellation's fault. The block's side effects run again on each attempt.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Backoff(d i64) RetryPolicy[T]`: Backoff is r waiting d before the second attempt, and twice as long before each later one.
- `(r RetryPolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run runs body until it succeeds, attempts runs have failed, or the boundary is cancelled.
- `SetTracer(f fn(str, i64, fault))`: SetTracer sends this core's trace spans to f(name, duration in ns, fault or nil) instead of the log.
- `type TracePolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: TracePolicy reports each run of its block (Trace).
- `Trace[T constraints.Any](name str) TracePolicy[T]`: Trace is a policy that reports its block's name, duration and fault to the core's tracer (a herald line by default).
- `(t TracePolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run runs body once and reports it.
- `type Cache[T constraints.Any] struct`: Cache is a per-core store for Cached: declare it in a package-level let. Values are kept (copied to the long-lived heap).
- `NewCache[T constraints.Any](max i64) Cache[T]`: NewCache makes a cache of at most max entries (at least one); a full cache drops its oldest entry.
- `(c Cache[T]) Len() i64`: Len is the number of entries, fresh or expired.
- `(c mut Cache[T]) Drop(key str)`: Drop removes key's entry.
- `type CachedPolicy[T constraints.Any] struct`: CachedPolicy answers its block from a cache (Cached).
- `Cached[T constraints.Any](c Cache[T], key str, ttl i64) CachedPolicy[T]`: Cached is a policy that gives the value cached under key while it is younger than ttl (ns), without running its block; otherwise it runs the block and caches a value it gives. Faults are not cached.
- `(p mut CachedPolicy[T]) Run(body fn() !T) !T`: Run gives the cached value, or runs body and caches its value.

## redis

Package redis is a Redis client. Commands are queries: in c.Do("SET user:{id} {body}") the values travel as separate arguments, so a value can never change a command.

Each core keeps one connection per Client. The requests a core serves at the same time share it: their commands are written together and the replies matched in order (pipelining), so a busy server makes few system calls per command. Inside a request task a call waits without blocking the core; outside one it blocks.

```tin body
let cache = redis.Open(redis.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:6379"})
try cache.Set("greeting", "hello")
let (v, found) = try cache.Get("greeting")
```

Blocking commands (BLPOP, SUBSCRIBE, ...) would hold up the commands queued behind them and are not supported.

- `type Reply enum`: Reply is one Redis reply.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `ParseURL(url str) !Options`: ParseURL reads "redis://[[user]:password@]host[:port][/db]"; "rediss://" is the same over TLS 1.3 (TLS is set, so the server's certificate is verified for host).
- `type Client struct`: Client sends commands to one Redis server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(c Client) Do(q query) !Reply`: Do sends one command and returns its reply; an error reply fails.
- `(c Client) Pipe(qs []query) ![]Reply`: Pipe sends commands together and returns their replies in order; error replies come back as Err. The commands go out back to back, so MULTI ... EXEC in one Pipe is atomic.
- `(c Client) Get(key str) !(str, bool)`: Get returns the value at key, and whether there is one.
- `(c Client) Set(key str, value str) !`: Set stores value at key.
- `(c Client) SetEx(key str, value str, ttl i64) !`: SetEx stores value at key for ttl nanoseconds (at least a millisecond).
- `(c Client) Del(key str) !i64`: Del removes key; it returns how many keys it removed (0 or 1).
- `(c Client) Incr(key str) !i64`: Incr adds one to the integer at key and returns the result.
- `(c Client) Expire(key str, ttl i64) !bool`: Expire makes key expire after ttl nanoseconds; false when there is no such key.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.

## mysql

Package mysql is a MySQL client (tested with MySQL 8.0). Statements are queries: in db.Query("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = {id}") the text becomes "... id = ?" and id a bound parameter of a prepared statement, so a value can never change a statement.

Each core keeps a pool of connections per Client (Options.Pool, default max(2, 64/cores); Options.MaxTotal caps them for the process); a request task waits for a free one without blocking the core. Prepared statements are cached per connection. Authentication: caching_sha2_password (the MySQL 8 default, including the RSA key exchange when the server has no cached entry) and mysql_native_password. Options.TLS connects over TLS 1.3 (SSLRequest), verifying the server's certificate and name.

Sizing: a Client opened in a global's initializer is opened on every core, so a 32-core pod with Pool 16 may open 512 connections to one server, and a fleet of pods multiplies that. Pool, when not set, is max(2, 64/cores) per core: about 64 for the process, at least 2 on each core. Options.MaxTotal caps the connections of the whole process, over all cores (Clients with the same address, user, database and MaxTotal share one cap): a core at the cap waits, within the request's deadline and Options.Timeout, until a connection is released or a core that has one idle gives up its slot. Set MaxTotal to at least the number of cores that serve database requests; below that, cores share connections by closing and dialing again.

```tin body
let pw = quarry.Getenv("MYSQL_PASSWORD")
let id = 7
let db = mysql.Open(mysql.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:3306", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
let rows = try db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = {id}")
for r in rows.Rows {
	say.Line(r[0].Int(), r[1].Text())
}
```

- `type Value enum`: Value is one column of a row.
- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one MySQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the server in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(v Value) IsNull() bool`: IsNull reports whether v is NULL.

- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement and returns its rows.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement and returns what it changed.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin starts a transaction; finish it with Commit or Rollback, or its connection stays out of the pool.
- `(t mut Tx) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query runs a statement in the transaction and returns its rows.
- `(t mut Tx) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec runs a statement in the transaction.
- `(t mut Tx) Commit() !`: Commit makes the transaction's changes permanent.
- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes.

## postgres

Package postgres is a PostgreSQL protocol 3.0 client over TCP. Query interpolation binds binary parameters as $1, $2, ...; a plain str cannot be used as SQL. Connections are pooled per core (Options.Pool, default max(2, 64/cores); Options.MaxTotal caps them for the process) and waiting request tasks park without blocking it. Authentication supports SCRAM-SHA-256, MD5 and cleartext. Options.SSLMode turns on TLS 1.3 (SSLRequest): "require" encrypts, "verify-full" (the default when Options.TLS is set) also checks the server's certificate and name.

Sizing: a Client opened in a global's initializer is opened on every core, so a 32-core pod with Pool 16 may open 512 connections to one server, and a fleet of pods multiplies that. Pool, when not set, is max(2, 64/cores) per core: about 64 for the process, at least 2 on each core. Options.MaxTotal caps the connections of the whole process, over all cores (Clients with the same address, user, database and MaxTotal share one cap): a core at the cap waits, within the request's deadline and Options.Timeout, until a connection is released or a core that has one idle gives up its slot. Set MaxTotal to at least the number of cores that serve database requests; below that, cores share connections by closing and dialing again.

```tin body
let pw = quarry.Getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")
let name = "ana"
let db = postgres.Open(postgres.Options{Addr: "127.0.0.1:5432", User: "app", Password: pw, Database: "shop"})
let rows = try db.Query("INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES ({name}) RETURNING id")
let id = rows.Rows[0][0].Int()
```

- `type Rows struct`: Rows is a query's result.
- `type Result struct`: Result is what a statement without rows did.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect.
- `type Client struct`: Client runs statements on one PostgreSQL server. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Tx struct`: Tx is a transaction: its statements run on one connection until Commit or Rollback.

- `(v Value) Int() i64`: Int is v as an integer (a Text or Float converted, NULL and bad text 0).
- `(v Value) Float() f64`: Float is v as a float.
- `(v Value) Text() str`: Text is v as text ("" for NULL).
- `(r Rows) Col(name str) i64`: Col is the index of the named column, or -1.
- `(c Client) Query(q query) !Rows`: Query returns the first rowset. With no parameters, multiple statements are allowed and all replies are consumed before returning. Integers and booleans use Value.Int; float4/8 use Value.Float; other OIDs (including numeric and bytea) use Value.Text.
- `(c Client) Exec(q query) !Result`: Exec returns the affected count of the last command. Use Query with RETURNING to obtain generated IDs (PostgreSQL has no connection-wide last insert ID).
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that the server answers.
- `(c Client) Begin() !Tx`: Begin pins a connection until Commit or Rollback. SQL errors abort the transaction until Rollback. Copies share its state: finishing one finishes them all. In request tasks an unfinished transaction is dropped when its owning task/scope ends. Outside tasks always finish explicitly. Tx and its rows belong to the caller's pool.

- `(t mut Tx) Rollback() !`: Rollback undoes the transaction's changes and releases its connection.

## kafka

Package kafka is an Apache Kafka client: a producer (idempotent by default, with batching and gzip, snappy, lz4 and zstd compression), fetching from partitions (read_committed too), consumer groups with rebalancing, transactions, and administration of topics, partitions, records, groups and configs. It speaks Kafka's binary protocol directly (request versions brokers 2.4 to 4.x accept; run against 3.9 and 4.2), over plain TCP or TLS 1.3, with SASL PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256 or SCRAM-SHA-512.

Each core keeps one connection per broker for each Client. The requests a core serves at the same time share a connection, and sends of the same turn to one partition share a record batch, so a busy service makes few requests. Inside a request task a call waits without blocking the core; outside one it blocks.

```tin body
let bus = kafka.Open(kafka.Options{Brokers: []str{"127.0.0.1:9092"}})
let ack = try bus.Send("orders", kafka.Message{Key: "7", Value: "paid"})
let records = try bus.Fetch("orders", ack.Partition, ack.Offset, 1s)
```

A key picks the partition the way the Java client does (murmur2), so a key lands on the same partition from either. Consumer groups: Group and design/design_kafka.md (section 3) for where a consumer loop runs. Transactions: Transactional.

- `type TopicSpec struct`: TopicSpec describes a topic to create.
- `type Config struct`: Config is one configuration entry.
- `type Resource enum`: Resource is what a config belongs to.
- `type GroupListing struct`: GroupListing is one group a cluster knows.
- `type GroupMember struct`: GroupMember is one member of a described group.
- `type GroupDescription struct`: GroupDescription is the state of a group.
- `(c Client) CreateTopic(name str, partitions i64, replicas i64) !`: CreateTopic makes a topic. It fails with ErrTopicExists when there already is one.
- `(c Client) CreateTopics(specs []TopicSpec) !`: CreateTopics makes topics; the first failure fails the call (ErrTopicExists for one that exists).
- `(c Client) DeleteTopics(names []str) !`: DeleteTopics removes topics.
- `(c Client) ListTopics() ![]str`: ListTopics is the names of the cluster's topics (internal ones too).
- `(c Client) CreatePartitions(topic str, total i64) !`: CreatePartitions grows topic to total partitions.
- `(c Client) DeleteRecords(topic str, partition i64, before i64) !i64`: DeleteRecords deletes the records of the partition before offset; it returns the partition's new first offset.
- `(c Client) ListGroups() ![]GroupListing`: ListGroups lists the groups of the whole cluster (each broker knows those it coordinates).
- `(c Client) DescribeGroup(group str) !GroupDescription`: DescribeGroup is the state, protocol and members of group.
- `(c Client) DeleteGroups(groups []str) !`: DeleteGroups removes empty groups and their committed offsets.
- `(c Client) DescribeConfigs(kind Resource, name str) ![]Config`: DescribeConfigs is the configuration of a topic or a broker (a broker by its node id).
- `(c Client) SetConfig(kind Resource, name str, key str, value str) !`: SetConfig sets one config of a topic or a broker (IncrementalAlterConfigs: the others stay).
- `(c Client) ResetConfig(kind Resource, name str, key str) !`: ResetConfig removes one config of a topic or a broker, back to its default.
- `(c Client) Close()`: Close closes this core's connections of the client; the next request connects again. Requests waiting on them fail, including one another task is waiting on (a held fetch).
- `type Want struct`: Want names a partition and the offset to read it from.
- `type Part struct`: Part is what a fetch learned about one partition.
- `type Fetched struct`: Fetched is the records of a FetchAll, in partition order, and what it learned of each partition.
- `(c Client) Fetch(topic str, partition i64, offset i64, maxWait i64) ![]Record`: Fetch reads records of topic's partition from offset on. It returns as soon as there are records, or empty after maxWait nanoseconds with none. At most Options.FetchMax bytes of whole record batches come back; a record before offset is skipped. They decompress to at most 64 times the larger of FetchMax and the bytes fetched: batches past that come in the next fetch, and one batch larger than it fails (raise FetchMax). An offset outside the partition fails with ErrOffsetOutOfRange.
- `(c Client) FetchAll(wants []Want, maxWait i64) !Fetched`: FetchAll reads several partitions at once: one request per leader broker, all sent before any is waited for when called inside a task. A partition whose offset is out of range is reported in Parts, not as a fault.
- `(c Client) Offsets(topic str, partition i64) !(i64, i64)`: Offsets returns the first offset still in partition and the offset the next record will get.
- `(c Client) OffsetAt(topic str, partition i64, ts i64) !i64`: OffsetAt is the first offset whose record's timestamp is at or after ts (ms since the epoch), or -1 when every record is older.
- `type Assignor enum`: Assignor is how a group's leader spreads partitions over its members.
- `type Start enum`: Start is where a member starts reading a partition the group has no offset for.
- `type GroupOptions struct`: GroupOptions describe a member.
- `type Group struct`: Group is this core's member of a consumer group.
- `type TopicPartition struct`: TopicPartition names a partition and an offset (a position or a committed offset).
- `(c Client) Group(o GroupOptions) !Group`: Group makes this core's member of a consumer group. It joins on the first Poll.
- `(g Group) MemberID() str`: MemberID is the id the coordinator gave this member ("" before it joined).
- `(g Group) Generation() i64`: Generation is the group generation this member is in (-1 before it joined).
- `(g Group) Assigned() []TopicPartition`: Assigned is the member's partitions with the offset each will be read from next (-1 until known).
- `(g Group) Seek(topic str, partition i64, offset i64) !`: Seek makes the next Poll read the member's partition from offset.
- `(g Group) Heartbeat() !`: Heartbeat tells the coordinator the member is alive (Poll does it when due). A rebalance makes the next Poll rejoin.
- `(g Group) Poll(maxWait i64) ![]Record`: Poll returns the next records of the member's partitions, waiting up to maxWait (less when a heartbeat falls due). It joins the group first, rejoins after a rebalance, heartbeats, and unless ManualCommit is set commits what the previous Poll returned.
- `(g Group) Commit() !`: Commit stores the member's positions (the offsets after the records Poll returned) as the group's committed offsets. A rebalance in the meantime fails it with ErrRebalance.
- `(g Group) CommitOffsets(parts []TopicPartition) !`: CommitOffsets stores the given offsets (each the next offset to read) for the group.
- `(g Group) Close() !`: Close commits (unless ManualCommit) and leaves the group, so its partitions move to the other members at once. A static member (InstanceID) does not leave: its session keeps its partitions for a restart.
- `(c Client) Commit(group str, topic str, partition i64, offset i64) !`: Commit stores offset as group's position in the partition, without being a member (the "simple consumer" commit: generation -1). The offset is the next one to read.
- `(c Client) Committed(group str, topic str, partition i64) !i64`: Committed is the offset group last committed for the partition, or -1 when it has none.
- `type Mechanism enum`: Mechanism is the SASL mechanism used when Options.Username is set.
- `type Acks enum`: Acks says which replicas must have a record before Send returns.
- `type Options struct`: Options says where and how to connect, and how to produce and fetch.
- `type Client struct`: Client talks to one Kafka cluster. Open it in a global's initializer (which runs on every core) or once in main, not per request.
- `type Ack struct`: Ack says where Send put a record. Offset is -1 with Acks.NoAck, and when an idempotent retry found the batch already written.
- `Open(o Options) Client`: Open makes a client for the cluster in o. It connects on first use, on each core.
- `(c Client) Partitions(topic str) !i64`: Partitions is how many partitions topic has (asking the cluster). A topic created a moment ago may not be in every broker's metadata yet, so an unknown topic is asked about again for a little while (about two seconds) before the call fails with ErrUnknownTopic; so is one still being created, which has no partitions yet.
- `(c Client) Ping() !`: Ping checks that a broker answers.
- `(c Client) Send(topic str, m Message) !Ack`: Send appends one record to topic and returns where it went. A record with a key goes to the partition the key hashes to; one without goes to one partition per call, in turn.
- `(c Client) SendTo(topic str, partition i64, m Message) !Ack`: SendTo appends one record to a chosen partition of topic.
- `(c Client) SendBatchTo(topic str, partition i64, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatchTo appends records to a chosen partition of topic, in one batch with what other tasks of this core send there meanwhile.
- `(c Client) SendBatch(topic str, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatch appends records to topic and returns where each went, in order. Records of one partition go in one batch (with what other tasks of this core send meanwhile). A failed batch fails the call; records of other partitions may already be written.
- `type Message struct`: Message is one record to send.
- `type Header struct`: Header is a record header.
- `type Record struct`: Record is a record read from a partition.
- `type Compression enum`: Compression codecs, as the record batch attributes number them.
- `Murmur2(data str) i64`: Murmur2 is the hash Kafka's default partitioner uses for keys (Java's Utils.murmur2), so a key lands on the same partition here as from the Java client.
- `PartitionFor(key str, n i64) i64`: PartitionFor is the partition Kafka's default partitioner picks for key among n partitions; -1 when n is below 1.
- `EncodeBatch(ms []Message, now i64, c Compression) str`: EncodeBatch is ms as one record batch (format 2) compressed with c, the bytes Kafka stores and sends, with offsets counted from 0. A message whose Timestamp is 0 gets now (ms since the epoch).
- `DecodeBatches(data str) ![]Record`: DecodeBatches reads the record batches in data, as a Fetch response carries them, with any codec. A batch the data ends in the middle of is dropped; a damaged one, a changed byte (CRC-32C) or an old message format fails. Control batches (transaction markers) are skipped. All the batches together may decompress to at most 64 times the larger of 1 MiB and len(data).
- `type Txn struct`: Txn is this core's transactional producer for one transactional id. It serves one task at a time: a call made while another task's call is in progress fails with ErrTransaction (two sends to one partition at once would share a sequence, and the broker would drop one as a duplicate). After a send fails the transaction can only be aborted, since the broker may have written that send's records; Abort then starts the producer again with a new epoch.
- `(c Client) Transactional(txid str, timeout i64) !Txn`: Transactional makes this core's producer for transactional id txid (timeout: how long the broker lets a transaction stay open, default 60 s). It fences any older producer with the same id, and aborts what that one left open. Making it again for the same id (after fencing or a transaction timeout) replaces this core's producer of that id: older Txn values of it fail. A core holds at most 64; Close frees one.
- `(t Txn) Close()`: Close frees this core's slot of the producer. A transaction still open is left to the broker, which aborts it at its timeout or when the id is used again.
- `(t Txn) Begin() !`: Begin starts a transaction.
- `(t Txn) Send(topic str, m Message) !Ack`: Send writes one record in the open transaction.
- `(t Txn) SendBatch(topic str, ms []Message) ![]Ack`: SendBatch writes records in the open transaction, one batch per partition; readers with ReadCommitted see them only once the transaction commits.
- `(t Txn) SendOffsets(group str, offsets []TopicPartition) !`: SendOffsets commits a consumer group's offsets as part of the open transaction (consume-transform-produce): they become the group's committed offsets only if the transaction commits.
- `(t Txn) Commit() !`: Commit commits the open transaction: its records become visible to ReadCommitted readers and its offsets the group's. After a failed send it fails: only Abort is left.
- `(t Txn) Abort() !`: Abort discards the open transaction. After a failed send it starts the producer again (InitProducerId: the coordinator aborts the transaction and gives a new epoch, and every partition's sequence starts over), as Java does (KIP-360): records the broker may have written for the failed send cannot make a later send look like their duplicate.

## websocket

Package websocket is the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455): Accept upgrades an anvil request, Dial connects to a server (ws://, or wss:// over TLS 1.3). Messages are text or binary; pings are answered and fragments joined inside Read. Inside a request task a Read waits without blocking the core, so one core holds many idle connections.

```tin
fn handle(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) {
	let ws = websocket.Accept(q, mut w) catch _ { return }
	ws.Each(echo) catch _ {}
}

fn echo(ws websocket.Conn, m websocket.Message) ! {
	try ws.WriteText("echo: {m.Data}")
}
```

- `type Message struct`: Message is one complete message.
- `type Conn struct`: Conn is a WebSocket connection.
- `Accept(q anvil.Req, w mut anvil.Out) !Conn`: Accept completes the opening handshake for request q and takes over its connection. A request that is not a WebSocket handshake gets a 400 (426 for another version) in w and fails. The connection and its buffers close when the handler returns.
- `Dial(url str) !Conn`: Dial connects to a ws:// or wss:// URL ("ws://host:port/path"); wss:// verifies the server's certificate against the system's roots. Close it when finished; inside a request task, it is also closed automatically when its scope ends.
- `DialTLS(url str, cfg tls.Config) !Conn`: DialTLS is Dial with the TLS configuration of a wss:// URL (RootCAs, Timeout for the handshake, InsecureSkipVerify for tests); the server name is the URL's host, and ALPN offers http/1.1 whatever cfg.ALPN says (the upgrade is HTTP/1.1).
- `(c Conn) SetTimeout(ns i64)`: SetTimeout limits every later read and write to ns nanoseconds (0: no limit).
- `(c Conn) SetMaxMessage(n i64)`: SetMaxMessage sets the largest message Read accepts (default 16 MiB); a bigger one closes the connection with 1009.
- `(c Conn) WriteText(s str) !`: WriteText sends s as a text message.
- `(c Conn) WriteBinary(b []u8) !`: WriteBinary sends b as a binary message.
- `(c Conn) Ping() !`: Ping sends a ping; the peer's pong is consumed by Read.
- `(c Conn) CloseWith(code i64, reason str) !`: CloseWith sends a close frame with code and reason; the connection then only drains.
- `(c Conn) Close()`: Close sends a normal close (1000) and, for a client, closes the connection.
- `IsClosed(err fault) bool`: IsClosed reports whether err is the normal end of a connection: the peer closed it.
- `(c Conn) Read() !Message`: Read returns the next message; it answers pings and joins fragments on the way. When the peer closes, it answers the close and fails with "websocket: closed (code)". The returned message lives in the caller's pool. For a long-lived stream, use Each to reset message allocations after every callback without invalidating the Conn.
- `(c Conn) Each(h fn(Conn, Message) !) !`: Each reads messages and calls h until a read or callback fails. Every callback has a reusable message pool: use keep() to retain its data after the callback returns. The Conn and all objects allocated before Each remain valid. Callbacks may wait. A closed peer returns the same IsClosed fault as Read; callback faults propagate.

## atomic

Package atomic has counters and flags that every core may change at once. Keep one in a `shared let` (a value every core reads, built once before the cores start), as in `shared let hits = atomic.NewInt(0)`, and call `hits.Add(1)` from any core; the operations are indivisible and ordered (sequentially consistent) across the whole process. A value made anywhere else (in a handler, in a per-core global) lives in one core's memory and must not be shared. Integers and flags only: build anything bigger with relay messages or per-core state.

- `type Int struct`: Int is an integer that cores read and change with indivisible operations.
- `NewInt(v i64) Int`: NewInt returns an Int holding v.
- `(c Int) Load() i64`: Load returns the value.
- `(c Int) Store(v i64)`: Store sets the value to v.
- `(c Int) Add(n i64) i64`: Add adds n (negative to subtract) and returns the new value.
- `(c Int) Swap(v i64) i64`: Swap sets the value to v and returns the one it replaced.
- `(c Int) CompareSwap(old i64, next i64) bool`: CompareSwap sets the value to next if it is old, and reports whether it did.
- `type Bool struct`: Bool is a flag that cores read and change with indivisible operations.
- `NewBool(v bool) Bool`: NewBool returns a Bool holding v.
- `(c Bool) Load() bool`: Load returns the flag.
- `(c Bool) Store(v bool)`: Store sets the flag to v.
- `(c Bool) Swap(v bool) bool`: Swap sets the flag to v and returns the value it replaced.
- `(c Bool) CompareSwap(old bool, next bool) bool`: CompareSwap sets the flag to next if it is old, and reports whether it did.

## lane

Package lane is a bounded queue between the tasks of one core (Go's buffered channel): lane.New[T](n) makes one that holds n values, Send waits while it is full and Recv while it is empty, and both take the task's deadline and cancellation like any other wait. Close ends it: senders fail at once and receivers drain what is left, then fail with ErrClosed. In main (outside a task) a wait runs the core's other tasks until it can go on. Ready, Watch and Unwatch are what select uses. A lane never crosses cores: relay does that.

A worker ends its loop when the lane is closed and drained, and on nothing else: its loop is `let j = jobs.Recv() catch err { if fault.Is(err, lane.ErrClosed) { return }  fail err }`, or `let (j, ok) = try jobs.RecvOk()` and `if !ok { return }`. A deadline or a cancellation is still fault.DeadlineExceeded or fault.Canceled.

- `type Lane[T constraints.Any] struct`: Lane is a bounded queue between tasks on one core (design_semantics §6, #232). Send waits while it is full and Recv while it is empty; Close wakes every waiter. Waits take the task's deadline and cancellation like any other wait. A lane never crosses cores (relay does).
- `New[T constraints.Any](capacity i64) Lane[T]`: New makes a lane that holds at most capacity values (at least one).
- `(l mut Lane[T]) Send(v T) !`: Send puts v at the back, waiting while the lane is full; it fails with ErrClosed once the lane is closed.
- `(l mut Lane[T]) TrySend(v T) bool`: TrySend puts v at the back if there is room and reports whether it did.
- `(l mut Lane[T]) Recv() !T`: Recv takes the value at the front, waiting while the lane is empty; it fails with ErrClosed once the lane is closed and empty.
- `(l mut Lane[T]) RecvOk() !(T, bool)`: RecvOk is Recv with Go's v, ok := <-ch: ok is false (and v the zero value) once the lane is closed and empty, and only a deadline or a cancellation is a fault.
- `(l mut Lane[T]) Close()`: Close ends the lane: senders fail, receivers drain what is left and then fail.
- `(l Lane[T]) Ready() bool`: Ready reports whether Recv would not wait: a value is there or the lane is closed (select).
- `(l mut Lane[T]) Watch()`: Watch makes the next value or Close wake the running task without taking a value (select).
- `(l mut Lane[T]) Unwatch()`: Unwatch withdraws Watch.
- `(l Lane[T]) Len() i64`: Len is how many values wait in the lane.

## replay

Package replay records a request's effects into a sealed capsule and reads capsules back, for `tin replay` (design/interface_replay.md). Reading replay capsules (section 6; #242): the envelope's tag and keystream, the body, and the effect kinds this build can replay. Writing capsules, the spool and the keys of secrets are #241's, in write.tin.

- `type Capsule struct`: Capsule is a decoded capsule: one recorded request and its effect records.
- `const Kinds = ",sched.select@1,sched.resume@1,sched.cancel@1,tide.now@1,tide.wall@1,dice.seed@1,seal.random@1,wire.http@1,wire.dial@1,wire.read@1,wire.write@1,redis@1,kafka@1,mysql@1,mysql.tx@1,postgres@1,postgres.tx@1,websocket.dial@1,websocket.read@1,websocket.write@1,quarry.read@1,quarry.write@1,quarry.stat@1,quarry.dir@1,quarry.fs@1,"`: Kinds lists the effect kinds (name@version) this build replays (section 4); a capsule with any other kind is refused. The sched.* kinds are the request's scheduling (section 7, #243).
- `Open(path str, keyHex str) !Capsule`: Open reads the capsule at path, encrypted under keyHex (the 64 hex digits of TIN_REPLAY_KEY).
- `Key(keyHex str) !str`: Key is the 32 bytes a TIN_REPLAY_KEY value (64 hex digits) stands for.
- `Unseal(data str, key str) !str`: Unseal checks a capsule envelope's tag under key and returns its decrypted body.
- `Decode(body str) !Capsule`: Decode reads a capsule body (schema 1 or 2) and checks every effect record and its kind.
- `Supported(kind str) bool`: Supported reports whether this build replays effect kind (name@version).
- `Setup(cores i64) bool`: Setup reads the switches (TIN_REPLAY_DIR, TIN_REPLAY_KEY, TIN_REPLAY_SAMPLE, TIN_REPLAY_MAX_MB, TIN_REPLAY_SECRET_HEADERS, TIN_REPLAY_DROP_HEADERS) for a server on n cores, trims the spool and installs the keyed hash of secrets; it reports whether recording is on (never while TIN_REPLAY_CAPSULE replays a capsule). Call it before the cores start. A missing or malformed key, or a spool that cannot be made, prints one line on stderr and leaves recording off.
- `On() bool`: On reports whether Setup turned recording on.
- `Secret(s str) str`: Secret is the handle an effect key or a stored header holds instead of a secret's text: "tin-secret:" and the first 16 bytes of HMAC-SHA256(Ks, s) in hex (section 5.1).
- `Wanted(status i64, panicked bool) i64`: Wanted is the flags a capsule of a request that ended with status is kept with (1 panicked, 2 sampled), or -1 when it is dropped: kept when the status is 500 or more, or it panicked, or it is in the TIN_REPLAY_SAMPLE fraction.
- `Done(tp i64, core i64)`: Done ends the recording tape tp of a request served on core: its capsule is written when the request is kept (Wanted), and the tape is freed. A capsule that cannot be written prints one line on stderr; the server goes on.
- `Write(tp i64, core i64, flags i64) !str`: Write writes the capsule of tape tp (recorded on core, with flags) into the spool, deleting the core's oldest capsules past its share of TIN_REPLAY_MAX_MB; it returns the capsule's path.
- `Encode(tp i64, core i64, flags i64) str`: Encode is the capsule body of tape tp (section 6): the request with its secret headers as handles and its dropped headers empty, the panic, the peer, and the effect records.
- `Seal(body str) str`: Seal is the envelope of a capsule body (section 6): the magic, a random nonce, the body under the HMAC-SHA256 keystream, and the tag over all of it.
- `Scrub(req str) str`: Scrub is a request as a capsule stores it: the values of secret headers (section 1) become their handles and the values of dropped headers become empty; everything else is kept.

## stencil

Package stencil renders templates loaded at run time, like Go's text/template over a dynamic value tree: {{.user.name}}, {{if}}, {{range}}, {{with}}, pipelines with the builtins (len, index, eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, and, or, not, printf, print, println, html, urlquery, js), {{define}}, {{template}} and {{block}}, and user functions registered with Func. Parse errors carry line and column; execution is bounded by a template recursion limit and a maximum output size. ParseHTML renders in HTML mode instead: an action's escaping follows its context in the surrounding markup (element text, attribute values, URL attributes and JavaScript inside <script>), and a context the mode cannot judge is a parse error rather than a guess.

URL attributes (href, src, action, formaction, poster, background) are escaped by position, as Go's html/template does: at the start the scheme is filtered (only http, https, mailto and relative URLs pass, else #ZgotmplZ) and the value is percent-encoded where it leaves the URL grammar; after the start it is percent-encoded the same way; after a "?" or "#" every byte outside the unreserved set is percent-encoded, so a value cannot add query parameters. Hex digits are lower case, then the value is HTML-escaped.

Execute keeps the data and the variables in a cell bound to a runtime slot (the pattern policy.Bind uses), so the stores happen inside the runtime.

- `type State struct`: State is one execution of a template.
- `type Node enum`: Node is one piece of a parsed template.
- `type Branch struct`: Branch is if/with: the condition, the body and the else branch.
- `type RangeNode struct`: RangeNode is range: the optional variables, the pipeline, the body and the else branch.
- `type TemplateCall struct`: TemplateCall is {{template "name" pipe}}; the pipe may be absent.
- `type Pipe struct`: Pipe is a pipeline: commands joined by |.
- `type Cmd struct`: Cmd is one command: its operands.
- `type Arg enum`: Arg is one operand of a command.
- `ParseHTML(name str, text str) !Template`: ParseHTML parses text into a Template whose actions are escaped by their HTML context, as Go's html/template does; a context the mode does not support is a parse error. A {{template}} call renders its own template in element text, so a called template cannot open a tag.
- `Parse(name str, text str) !Template`: Parse parses text into a Template; errors carry name, line and column.
- `type Parser struct`: Parser walks text.
- `type Value struct`: Value is the data a template renders: a tree of strings, numbers, booleans, lists and maps.
- `const KindNone = 0`: The kinds of a Value.
- `const KindStr = 1`
- `const KindInt = 2`
- `const KindFloat = 3`
- `const KindBool = 4`
- `const KindList = 5`
- `const KindMap = 6`
- `None() Value`: None returns the absent value (a missing map key), printed as Go prints it.
- `Str(s str) Value`: Str returns a string value.
- `Int(n i64) Value`: Int returns an integer value.
- `Float(f f64) Value`: Float returns a floating-point value.
- `Bool(b bool) Value`: Bool returns a boolean value.
- `List(xs []Value) Value`: List returns a list value.
- `Map(m map[str]Value) Value`: Map returns a map value; the keys are strings, as {{.name}} looks them up.
- `(v Value) Kind() i64`: Kind returns the value's kind (one of the Kind constants), for code that inspects data.
- `(v Value) String() str`: String returns the string of a string value.
- `(v Value) Integer() i64`: Integer returns the integer of an integer value.
- `(v Value) Real() f64`: Real returns the float of a floating-point value.
- `(v Value) Boolean() bool`: Boolean returns the boolean of a boolean value.
- `(v Value) Items() []Value`: Items returns the elements of a list value.
- `(v Value) Entries() map[str]Value`: Entries returns the map of a map value.
- `type Template struct`: Template is a parsed template.
- `(t mut Template) Func(name str, f fn([]Value) !Value)`: Func registers f for {{name ...}} calls in this template.
- `(t Template) Execute(data Value) !str`: Execute renders the template with data and returns the output.
- `(t Template) ExecuteTo(w mut twine.Builder, data Value) !`: ExecuteTo renders the template with data into w. The data and the variables live in a cell bound to a runtime slot for the call (the pattern policy.Bind uses).

## column

Package column aligns tabbed columns in text, like Go's text/tabwriter: the elastic tabstops algorithm.

The writer treats its input as cells terminated by a horizontal ('\t') or vertical ('\v') tab and lines broken by a newline ('\n') or form feed ('\f'). Tab-terminated cells in contiguous lines form a column, and the writer pads the cells so that every cell of a column has the same width:

```tin body
let text = try column.Format("a\tbb\tc\nlonger\tb\tdd\n", 0, 8, 1, ' ', 0)
// text is "a      bb c\nlonger b  dd\n"
```

NewWriter streams instead, into anything with Write (mut dyn io.Writer).

A form feed acts like a newline and also ends every column block (a flush). Columns ended entirely by vertical tabs are dropped when DiscardEmptyColumns is set. With FilterHTML, HTML tags are zero width and entities one; with tab padding (padchar '\t') cells are left-aligned, as Go's tabwriter has it.

- `const FilterHTML = 1`: The flags, as Go's tabwriter: FilterHTML ignores HTML tags and treats entities as one rune, StripEscape strips the Escape characters of escaped segments, AlignRight right-aligns cells, DiscardEmptyColumns drops columns that hold only empty cells ended by vertical tabs, TabIndent pads leading empty cells with tabs, and Debug writes a '|' between columns and a "---" line after a form feed.
- `const StripEscape = 2`
- `const AlignRight = 4`
- `const DiscardEmptyColumns = 8`
- `const TabIndent = 16`
- `const Debug = 32`
- `const Escape = 0xff`: Escape brackets an escaped segment: text between two of them is passed through and counts one rune per byte for the column width. 0xff cannot appear in valid UTF-8, which is why Go chose it.
- `type Writer struct`: Writer inserts padding around tab-terminated columns in what is written to it, and sends the result to put.
- `NewWriter(put dyn io.Writer, minwidth i64, tabwidth i64, padding i64, padchar u8, flags i64) !Writer`: NewWriter returns a writer that pads cells to at least minwidth (plus padding), counts a tab as tabwidth columns, uses padchar for the padding, and follows the flags. Negative minwidth, tabwidth or padding fail.
- `type StrSink struct`: StrSink collects what is written to it, for Format and for tests.
- `(s mut StrSink) Write(data []u8) !i64`: Write appends data to the sink.
- `Format(s str, minwidth i64, tabwidth i64, padding i64, padchar u8, flags i64) !str`: Format aligns the columns of s with the same parameters as NewWriter and returns the result: the common one-shot use.
- `(w mut Writer) Flush() !`: Flush writes the buffered text, padding the columns; an incomplete escape at the end counts as complete.
- `(w mut Writer) Write(buf []u8) !i64`: Write buffers the cells and lines of buf: tabs and vertical tabs end a cell, newlines and form feeds end a line (and a form feed flushes), and a line with a single cell is flushed at once since it cannot affect the following lines.

## scroll

Package scroll is a safe, streaming XML tokenizer and writer, like Go's encoding/xml without reflection: no DTD processing and no external entities, by design, so XXE and billion-laughs attacks cannot happen. Entities are the five predefined names and numeric references; anything else is an error. The tokenizer resolves namespaces into Name.Space and bounds nesting, the attribute count and the token size (fault.LimitExceeded). Writer writes tokens or direct calls with text and attribute escaping and optional indentation; the Go twin (bench/ref/scroll and tools/ci/scroll_check.tin) compares the token streams with encoding/xml over an RSS, SOAP, S3 and SVG corpus.

- `type Token enum`: Token is one piece of an XML document.
- `type Name struct`: Name is a name with its namespace: space is the URI the prefix resolved to, empty when there is none; local is the part after the prefix.

## scan

Package scan is a scanner and tokenizer for UTF-8 text, Go's text/scanner: it reads Go-style identifiers, numbers, char, string and raw string literals and comments, with Go's white space and position rules, for tokenizing source code, configuration files and small languages.

```tin body
mut s = scan.New("let x = 1.5 + y // the sum")
s.Filename = "example"
for {
	let tok = s.Scan()
	if tok == scan.EOF {
		break
	}
	say.Line(s.Position().String(), scan.TokenString(tok), s.TokenText())
}
```

The Scanner reads a whole str (a stream is read with io.ReadAll first), so a token's text is a slice of the source and positions are byte offsets into it. Scan returns a token kind (EOF, Ident, Int, Float, Char, String, RawString, Comment, all negative) or the rune itself for any other character. Mode selects the tokens recognized (GoTokens by default: comments are skipped), Whitespace the characters skipped, and SetIdentRune the identifier characters. Errors (a literal not terminated, a bad escape, invalid UTF-8, a NUL) do not stop the scan: they are counted in ErrorCount and the first thousand are kept with their positions, read with Errors and Err. Lines and columns are 1-based, a column counts characters, and a leading byte order mark is skipped; the Go twin (bench/ref/scan and tools/ci/scan_check.tin) checks every token, position and error against Go's.

- `const EOF = -1`: EOF is the end of the source. The token kinds are negative, so a character Scan returns is never one.
- `const Ident = -2`: Ident is an identifier.
- `const Int = -3`: Int is an integer literal.
- `const Float = -4`: Float is a floating-point literal.
- `const Char = -5`: Char is a character literal.
- `const String = -6`: String is an interpreted string literal.
- `const RawString = -7`: RawString is a raw (backquoted) string literal.
- `const Comment = -8`: Comment is a comment, returned when ScanComments is set without SkipComments.
- `const ScanIdents = 4`: ScanIdents recognizes identifiers (the Mode bit 1 << -Ident).
- `const ScanInts = 8`: ScanInts recognizes integer literals.
- `const ScanFloats = 16`: ScanFloats recognizes floating-point literals, integers and hexadecimal floats included.
- `const ScanChars = 32`: ScanChars recognizes character literals.
- `const ScanStrings = 64`: ScanStrings recognizes interpreted string literals.
- `const ScanRawStrings = 128`: ScanRawStrings recognizes raw string literals.
- `const ScanComments = 256`: ScanComments recognizes comments.
- `const SkipComments = 512`: SkipComments, with ScanComments, makes comments white space instead of Comment tokens.
- `const GoTokens = ScanIdents | ScanFloats | ScanChars | ScanStrings | ScanRawStrings | ScanComments | SkipComments`: GoTokens is every Go literal token with comments skipped: the Mode Init sets.
- `const GoWhitespace = 1<<9 | 1<<10 | 1<<13 | 1<<32`: GoWhitespace is the Whitespace Init sets: tab, newline, carriage return and space.
- `type Position value struct`: Position is a place in the source: valid when Line > 0.
- `(p Position) IsValid() bool`: IsValid reports whether the position is valid (Line > 0).

- `type Error value struct`: Error is one error the scanner met: where, as Go reports it, and what.
- `(e Error) String() str`: String is "position: message", the line Go prints when no Error function is set.
- `type Scanner struct`: Scanner reads the characters and tokens of a source text; make one with New.
- `New(src str) Scanner`: New returns a Scanner over src, initialized as Init does.
- `(s mut Scanner) Init(src str)`: Init restarts s on src: no errors, Mode GoTokens, Whitespace GoWhitespace and no token position; Filename and the identifier predicate stay.
- `(s mut Scanner) SetIdentRune(f fn(i32, i64) bool)`: SetIdentRune makes f decide the characters of identifiers: f(ch, i) accepts ch as the i-th rune (from 0) of one. It must not accept white space characters.
- `(s mut Scanner) ResetIdentRune()`: ResetIdentRune goes back to Go identifiers: a letter or '_', then letters, digits and '_'.
- `(s mut Scanner) Next() i32`: Next reads and returns the next character (EOF at the end) and makes Position invalid; Pos is the position after it.
- `(s mut Scanner) Peek() i32`: Peek returns the next character without advancing (EOF at the end).
- `(s Scanner) Errors() []Error`: Errors returns the errors met since Init, at most the first thousand (ErrorCount counts them all).
- `(s Scanner) Err() !`: Err fails with the first error ("position: message") when there was one.
- `(s mut Scanner) Scan() i32`: Scan reads the next token or character and returns it: a token kind for a token Mode recognizes, EOF at the end, or else the character itself. Position is where it starts, TokenText its text.
- `(s Scanner) Position() Position`: Position is where the token Scan last returned starts; Init and Next make it invalid.
- `(s Scanner) Pos() Position`: Pos is the position just after the character or token Next or Scan last returned.
- `(s Scanner) TokenText() str`: TokenText is the text of the token Scan last returned ("" after Next).
- `TokenString(tok i32) str`: TokenString is a printable form of a token kind ("EOF", "Ident", ...) or character (Go-quoted).

## textedit
