# Design: a complete Kafka client (`packages/kafka`) and the codecs it needs (`toolchain/std/squash`)

Status: decided for the first complete version. The roadmap box is "Queue and stream clients"
(design/roadmap.md).

## 1. Scope

Everything a service needs from Kafka, as Go's franz-go and sarama provide it:

| Area | Requests |
|---|---|
| Connections | ApiVersions (checked on every connection), SASL PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512, TLS 1.3 |
| Cluster | Metadata, FindCoordinator |
| Producer | Produce (acks 0, 1, all), InitProducerId (idempotent and transactional), compression gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd |
| Transactions | AddPartitionsToTxn, AddOffsetsToTxn, TxnOffsetCommit, EndTxn |
| Consumer | Fetch (many partitions at once, read_uncommitted and read_committed with aborted transactions removed, every codec), ListOffsets (earliest, latest, by time) |
| Groups | JoinGroup, SyncGroup, Heartbeat, LeaveGroup, OffsetCommit, OffsetFetch; range and round-robin assignors; static membership |
| Admin | CreateTopics, DeleteTopics, CreatePartitions, DeleteRecords, DescribeConfigs, IncrementalAlterConfigs, ListGroups, DescribeGroups, DeleteGroups |

Out of scope, by decision: the KIP-848 consumer protocol (ConsumerGroupHeartbeat; brokers keep the
classic protocol), share groups (KIP-932), the cooperative-sticky assignor (eager rebalancing only),
delegation tokens, OAUTHBEARER (it needs a token provider per service; PLAIN and SCRAM cover managed
Kafka offerings that use passwords), and ZooKeeper-era APIs.

## 2. Request versions

One version per request, without tagged fields (the last non-flexible version), so the encoder stays one
code path. They are the versions brokers from 2.4 to 4.x accept (run against 3.9 and 4.2); Kafka 4.0 removed only older versions
(KIP-896). On every connection the client sends ApiVersions first; a request whose version the broker
does not list fails with a message naming the request, the version and the broker's range, instead of the
broker closing the connection.

| Request | Version | Request | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Produce | 7 | Fetch | 10 |
| ListOffsets | 4 | Metadata | 7 |
| OffsetCommit | 7 | OffsetFetch | 5 |
| FindCoordinator | 2 | JoinGroup | 5 |
| Heartbeat | 3 | LeaveGroup | 3 |
| SyncGroup | 3 | DescribeGroups | 4 |
| ListGroups | 2 | SaslHandshake | 1 |
| ApiVersions | 2 | CreateTopics | 4 |
| DeleteTopics | 3 | DeleteRecords | 1 |
| InitProducerId | 1 | AddPartitionsToTxn | 1 |
| AddOffsetsToTxn | 1 | EndTxn | 1 |
| TxnOffsetCommit | 2 | DescribeConfigs | 2 |
| IncrementalAlterConfigs | 0 | SaslAuthenticate | 1 |
| CreatePartitions | 1 | DeleteGroups | 1 |

Produce 7 and Fetch 10 are the first versions that carry zstd (KIP-110). Brokers before 2.4 are not
supported.

## 3. Where a consumer runs

Tin has no threads to give a consumer, and heartbeats must go out while the application works. The
classic protocol allows a member to heartbeat from its poll loop as long as each poll comes within the
session timeout; the Java client did exactly that before 0.10.1. So:

- `Group.Poll(maxWait)` sends a due heartbeat, rejoins when the coordinator asked for a rebalance
  or when a subscribed topic's partitions changed, commits the previous poll's offsets when
  auto-commit is on, and fetches. It never waits longer than the time to the next heartbeat, so a
  poll loop with short handlers keeps the membership without anything running in the background.
- What a Poll does about the group's shape (#444):
  - The member counts as joined only once its positions are loaded. A failed OffsetFetch or
    ListOffsets leaves it rejoining: fetching at -1 answers OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE, jumps every
    partition to the end of its log and commits the records it skipped.
  - The assignor skips a subscribed topic the cluster has no metadata for (it does not exist yet,
    or this principal may not read it), so one missing topic does not stop the group. A partition
    whose start offset cannot be listed yet (it has no leader) keeps -1 and its fetch says why,
    while the partitions that can be read are.
  - When a heartbeat falls due, the member also refreshes its subscribed topics' metadata: a topic
    created after the join, partitions added to one, or a topic deleted, makes it rejoin, so a
    service started before its topic exists is assigned once it has partitions. A rejoin commits
    the positions first (as Java does when it revokes the partitions), so the new assignment does
    not deliver records twice.
  - The partitions take turns at the head of the fetch request: the per-partition and the request
    limit are both `FetchMax`, so a lagging first partition would starve the rest (Java rotates
    too).
  - A fetch that cannot reach one partition reports it per partition (`Part.Err`) together with the
    records of the healthy ones, and the member keeps its position for the next Poll.
  - The coordinator's address is cached until the broker says it is not the coordinator, and
    auto-commit waits `GroupOptions.CommitEvery` (default 5 s, as Java) instead of writing an
    OffsetCommit with every Poll.
- A handler that may run longer than the session timeout calls `g.Heartbeat()` itself, or the service sets
  `GroupOptions.Session` above its slowest handler.
- A long-running consumer in an anvil service lives in `detach { ... }` started from `on core.start`:
  every core can be a member of the group (members are per core, since nothing is shared between cores),
  and the drain cancels it, which makes it leave the group.
- In a plain program the poll loop runs in `main`; calls block the core, which is the only thing it does.

A member is a value owned by one core: `Group` holds per-core state the same way the connections do.

## 4. Producer

- Records with a key go to murmur2(key) mod partitions (the Java default); the records without a key
  of one call go to one partition, the next call's to the next, so unkeyed records still batch (a
  per-call form of KIP-480's sticky partitioner).
- `Send` waits for the broker's acknowledgement. Sends of one core's tasks to the same partition in the same
  turn of the event loop go out as one record batch: the first sender defers to the core's other ready
  tasks before it encodes, like the redis client's pipelining. One Produce request carries every partition
  that one broker leads.
- Idempotence (`Options.Idempotent`, on by default with acks all as in Kafka 3.0+): the client gets a
  producer id and epoch per core from InitProducerId and numbers each partition's batches, so a retried
  batch is never written twice. OUT_OF_ORDER_SEQUENCE and UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID reset the epoch.
- Compression is per client (`Options.Compression`): none, gzip, snappy (xerial framing as Kafka's Java
  client writes it, plain blocks read too), lz4 (frame format), zstd.
- A batch outlives the task that drives it. The caller owning a partition when a batch goes out may be
  cancelled while it is in flight (its deadline, a scope sibling, the drain); the frame was written
  either way, so its own boundary never decides the batch's fate:
  - The owner's deadline or cancellation ends its wait, not the batch: `sendNext` puts the batch's
    records back at the head of the accumulator, `produceBatch` rolls the sequence back with them, and
    the partition is passed to the next pending caller, which sends the batch again. An idempotent
    retry of a written batch gets DUPLICATE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER and reports no offset, exactly as the lost
    acknowledgement of the broker test does; without idempotence the retry may write the records twice,
    as Kafka's contract for a producer without idempotence allows.
  - A caller that gives up leaves its records pending: the next batch sends them and frees its waiter
    when they are done. Ownership passes to the first caller still waiting (one that gave up is
    skipped), so a partition is never left with a batch nobody sends, and no waiter is handed to a task
    that already left.
  - A batch the broker answered with a rejection it did not append (MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE, an invalid
    record, authorization) rolls the sequence back, and so does one whose every attempt was answered:
    only one batch per partition is in flight, so nothing else consumed the sequence, and the next
    batch reuses it instead of getting OUT_OF_ORDER and costing the client a new producer id. An
    ambiguous answer (NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS_AFTER_APPEND, REQUEST_TIMED_OUT, NETWORK_EXCEPTION) or a
    transport failure leaves the sequence consumed: the batch may have been written, and reusing its
    sequence would have the broker drop the next batch as a duplicate and lose its records.
  - A waiter's outcome is the fault itself, kept while the waiter outlives the failed call and copied
    back into the reporting caller's pool, so `fault.Is` holds for the deadline, cancel,
    ErrCoordinator, ErrTimedOut and broker-error faults a caller sees for a batch another task failed.
  - A recorded or replayed request (`TIN_REPLAY_DIR`) splits by `BatchMax` like live mode (section 8),
    so a batch that live mode would split is not refused once the request is recorded.

## 5. Transactions

A transactional producer is a value (`c.Transactional(id)`) whose transactional id is the caller's choice;
per core, because a producer id cannot be shared between threads that never synchronize. A service with
several cores gives each core its own id (for example `"{name}-{core}"`). `Begin`, `Send`,
`SendOffsets` (consume-transform-produce), `Commit` and `Abort` map one to one onto the protocol.

Three rules keep a transactional producer from losing records it reported as written (#442):

- **A failed send makes the transaction abort-only.** The request may have been written before
  its deadline, cancel or lost answer, so the partition's sequence is unknown: `Send`,
  `SendOffsets` and `Commit` then fail with `ErrTransaction`, and `Abort` runs InitProducerId
  again (the coordinator aborts the transaction and bumps the epoch; every sequence starts at 0),
  as Java does (KIP-360). Otherwise the next send would reuse the failed one's sequence and the
  broker would take it for a duplicate.
- **One task at a time.** A call made while another task's call on the same `Txn` waits on the
  network fails with `ErrTransaction`: two concurrent sends to one partition would share a
  sequence.
- **Slots.** A core holds 64 producers. Making one again for the same id reuses its slot (and
  makes older values of it fail); `Close` frees one.

## 6. Codecs: `toolchain/std/squash`

Kafka needs four codecs and the standard library had none. `squash` is a standard package (Go's
`compress/flate`, `compress/gzip`, `compress/zlib`, plus snappy, LZ4 and Zstandard), so other code can use
them too. DEFLATE, gzip and zlib are verified against a Go twin; snappy, LZ4 and Zstandard have no Go
standard package, so they are verified against their specifications' examples, round trips, and against
what Kafka's Java client writes and reads.

## 7. Connections

One connection per broker per client and core carries ordinary requests. A broker answers one request
of a connection at a time, so the requests it may hold (Fetch with a wait, JoinGroup, SyncGroup) go on
a second connection to the same broker; otherwise a long poll or a rebalance would hold up every send of
the core.

## 8. Replay

Every request the client sends is one `kafka@1` effect: its key is the request kind, version and body
(not the correlation id), its result the response body. A replayed request returns the recorded response
without a connection. The connection's handshake is not an effect. A request's effects must not depend
on what the core did before it, so while a tape is active the client asks for metadata on every use
instead of its cache, and sends without batching across requests and without a producer id. Group
members and transactional producers keep per-core state between requests and are not made
deterministic; they belong in `detach` tasks and `on` handlers, which have no tape.

## 9. Tests

- `toolchain/tests/v2/squash.tin` (+ Go twin `bench/ref/squash`) for the codecs.
- `toolchain/tests/v2/kafka.tin` needs nothing: protocol encoding, record batches with every codec, the partitioner.
- `toolchain/tests/v2/kafka_broker.tin` runs a fake cluster in the same process: four brokers on cores 1–4
  (cores do not share memory: they answer from a fixed layout), the client on core 0. It covers
  metadata, a moved leader, a lost acknowledgement with an idempotent retry, an unsupported request
  version, every codec, transactions read both ways, a group with a rebalance, admin requests and a
  wrong password. This is the CI check the roadmap asks for, without Python (`tools/ci` takes no new
  Python files) and without a Kafka install.
- `toolchain/tests/kafka/integration.tin` against real brokers (Apache Kafka 3.9 and Confluent 8.2, which is Kafka
  4.2), and Java interop in both directions for every codec, by hand (toolchain/tests/kafka/README.md).
